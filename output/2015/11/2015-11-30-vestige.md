Vestige lets you witness a dark and disturbing (however extremely beautiful  and expressive game environment. The atmosphere and story is handled brilliantly. You are trapped in some former Subway station and you have to escape (preferably alive)

The game requires you to utilize a decoy device to solve various puzzles. You actually do not use the device as decoy but you have to find creative alternative ways to find a solution.

The game was produced in 20 weeks with only 9 team members the game length is very short. I am looking forward to see what else these talented people will create in the future.
