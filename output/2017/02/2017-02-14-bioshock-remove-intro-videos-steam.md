Bioshock Remastered - Updated Graphics, but same old stupid multiple unskippable 2k Intro Video. Great…  
To avoid waiting to get the game going. You can add the flag “`-nointro`” to the launch options.

1. Right-click on the game in the Steam library and select “Properties”.
2. Then click on the button “Set Launch Options”
3. Add the flag "`-nointro`"
