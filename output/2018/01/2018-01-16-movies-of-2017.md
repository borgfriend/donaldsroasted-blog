# Great Movies

## Thor: Ragnarok

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7MGUNV8MxU

I really liked the first Thor movie and was very disappointed with the second Thor movie. Marvel simply did not know what to do with Thor he was not clicking with audiences. So they rebooted him by firing him and taking everything away from him, his hammer, his look and gave him a human side.

Thus combined with a story about loosing your job and then hanging out with friends and then getting a better job in the end, throw in a humble Rockmonster and Synthwave and you got yourself an awesome Thor movie.

It is a visual masterpiece and you really should go out and see it.

Filmjoy put it in much better words: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrxqRoB7EyI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrxqRoB7EyI https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrxqRoB7EyI)

## Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2

Vol. 2. brighter more colorful a much better story and a baby groot and somebody dies and it really makes you feel something. This one is all about family dynamics and situations you will encounter with your family (not with guns, explosions and spaceships)

## Lego Batman

This is probably the best Batman film ever created. It also contains every batman villan ever, and they are all defeated in the first 5 min of the movie. It is such a fun ride and such a great look at batman and robin.

A movie that only works because it was built in lego, and follows the true relationship between batman and joker.

## Coco

The trailer looks like crap, and that is because it has nothing to do with the real movie. Pixar again managed to pull all your heartstrings. It is visually stunning and the story is amazing.

# Watch once Movies

Awesome Movies, that are worth to rent/ watch once in your life

## Baby Driver

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9YZw\_X5UzQ

A Edgar Wright Masterpiece. A musical and the most fascinating world building and characters and unexpected story.

The trailers lie to you in a very good way, you will get a much grander and greater movie than you can expect.

## Valerian

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNrK7xVG3PM

So much potential, such a great world that was created. However it is all lost in a spectacle a weak story and a very forced romance.

The movie is beautiful and you should go see it just for that.

## Logan

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Div0iP65aZo

Well it is a modern take on the Western. It is an interesting story and takes a look at the past of wolverine and the future.

Overall it is also much more grittier and realistic, and the gore level is extremely high. While it is a movie for a very mature audience, the subject matter is very depressing and the ending only hints at a glimmer of hope for the future...

Many people really liked this movie - for me it was a great movie, but I would not want to watch it again.

# Mixed Movies

## Spiderman - Homecoming

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9DwoQ7HWvI

Frankly I do not care about Spiderman. The first trilogy was ok, the second was not so good and now we are here again and again we get to see Spiderman. - However this time around Marvel actually watched the last couple of Spiderman movies and said - "hmn lets let Spiderman only do things that he did not do in the last couple of movies.

However in the end it is a teenager drama movie that has probably one of the best marvel villans ever. And a really great spiderman. However spiderman is a teenager and he does one stupid thing after another, which makes it very cringeworthy at times.

# Bad Influences on Movies

## Wonder Woman

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q8fG0TtVAY

The movie had potential, a lot of potential, - the first two acts were brilliant. just they had to end the movie with a stupid monster fight. "Audiences want the big battle in the end" - no they do not want a big battle they want a satisfying ending. and they had one and then they ruined it.

Instead of diana learning the lesson that the amazons lied to her and that people are well just people and they fight eachother - no it was all the fault of a god and people are awesome - also diana is zeus? or the daughter of zeus? now that is the writers just ruining all the potential for the character - if she is flawless and a literal god, she cannot be hurt or killed and it sucks all the drama out of any next movie that will come.

Sadly if this is the "best" movie of the DC Universe - the DC Universe will not survive as this was only a half good movie.

## Star Wars: The Last Jedi

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0CbN8sfihY

Speaking of a literal god, Ray is so overpowered it is mind boggling. This movie is probably the worst thing that could have happened to the star wars universe. It practically told the audience you are silly for caring about star wars. They literally say: "Let the past die, kill it if you must" - telling the audience that you suck for loving star wars, especially the old star wars movies.

Nothing from the force awakens had any relevance, everything was meaningless. All fan theories sucked and in the name of "subverting expectations" everything was put on its head. And in the end nothing really made sense.

This movie has very strong influences from current radical feminism that it goes into misandry territory. All males are portrait as extremely stupid (Finn), reckless (xwing pilot), failed (Luke) while all woman are portrayed as perfect.

While ruining beloved characters from the original movies it also manages to permanently damage the lore of star wars.

Star Wars a film that was for everybody a space adventure has become into some weird political message thing. I do not know who the audience for this is - but it is definitely not the people who loved the original series.

This movie will probably mark the end of star wars as we know it. which would be ok and welcome, it would be great to see new stories without the Skywalkers family. But this movie makes me just feel deflated and tells me this movie is not for me but for a different audience. - too bad.
