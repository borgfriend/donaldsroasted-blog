# Transformers: Bumblebee

Oh god another Transformers movie? Yes, while I did not see the last couple of Transformer movies this one seems to have a plot and the design of Bumblebee and Star-scream are much better than the previous versions of the character. They got a new Writer [Christina Hodson](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5429637/?ref_=tt_ov_wr) for the movie that was not involved in the last couple of movies.Maybe the movie is going to have a real plot and more going for it than a hundred explosions.

# The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part

The aftermath of "Taco Tuesday" - a sequel to a movie nobody expected to be any good and the lego world is a wasteland.

# Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2

I am not sure about the trailer. Overall it looks very awful with a couple of really bad jokes. I hope it is going to be a really bad movie that is so bad that it is awesome.
