# Transformers: Bumblebee

Bumblebee is looking really promising, all transformers have clear influences from their first appearance in the tv series.

# Marvel: Captain Marvel

Marvel is opening the door for really wierd concepts like memory transfers and shapeshifters. The teaser does not show us a lot - but based on Marvels track record this is probably going to be really interesting.

# Mary Poppins Returns

The Disney Machine may or may not ruin a beloved classic.
