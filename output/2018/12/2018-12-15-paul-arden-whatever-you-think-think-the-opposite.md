This book explains the benefit of making the wrong decision.

## Risk is the Security of Life

Everyone is making the safe decision - that makes them predictable and replaceable. If you want to have the security to be relevant and stick around you need to take risks.

Unreason is better than reason. Having the Confidence to roll the dice changes the game. - It is the wrong way to think, but the right way to win.

You become trapped if you are making the sensible decisions. -> and so is everybody else. Unsafe decisions causesÂ  you to respond in a way you have not thought of.

### I wish vs I want

I wish

Wouldn't it be nice if making the safe decision - the one that everybody else makes -> you will be the same as everybody else.

I want

- If I want it enough I will get it.
- Making decisions you need to make to get what you want
- Safe decisions are dull predictable and lead to nowhere

> Start making bad decisions and it will take you to a place where others only dream of being
>
> Paul Arden

Most people take the easy option for an exciting life -> they live their excitement through other people.

When faced making the decision the interesting people took the outrageous choice without knowing what will happen. But they are for sure that the safe decision wouldn't be the right one.

### It is better to regret what you have done than what you haven't.

You can't afford the house of your dreams.

- either you find a way of getting it
- or be satisfied with dissatisfaction

Looking back you will regret things. Wrong decision? No, you always choose the right decision. It was the only one you could have made.

## Rock the boat

Old golfers do not win - they do not take the risky shot. They are hindered by experience. Being reckless gives you an edge.

### Do it, then fix it as you go.

Don't make it perfect, do it, then fix it. Ask for criticism not praise.

Take Charge and accept responsibility

No view is right - it always depends on your own standpoint. You are always right and you are always wrong.

If your work is fresh and new, do not expect it to be liked immediately. Most people have nothing to compare it to.

## What is a good idea? One that happens.

(if it doesn't, it isn't)

Even a bad idea executed is better than a good idea undone.

### It's not always good to have ideas

Oddly the ones who struggle most have the best ideas. It is too easy to move on to the next and the next.

## Resign

It's the way to show you mean business.

You cannot keep fighting and loosing it makes you the problem.

If you are good your resignation will not be accepted.

If they accept your resignation you were in the wrong job and it is better for you to move on.

It takes courage, but it is the right move.

### Fired

Best thing that can happen to you!

Just imagine you had been fired 10 days ago you wouldn't have a choice but to move on. You hated your situation anyway. You must begin again. It is a wonderful opportunity for you.

### Simply change your life

**The world is what you think of it. think different and the world will change.**
