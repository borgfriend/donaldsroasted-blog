## Cultivating your craft before your passion

What you do does not matter - the traits that are associated with it which make you happy. Skill precedes passion.

> Don't follow your passion; cultivate it.

## Everybody is an enterpreneur

Do not get misguided by the label they stamp on you. Always be improving "Finished" is not an option.

Employ your entrepreneurial Skills:

1. In which way are you better and different from other people? What are your strengths?
2. Plan to Adapt, create flexible plans
3. Build a network. Entrepreneurs are not loners, they have people that support them. They have a network that support them.
4. Take intelligent risks. Take on side projects in nights and weekends. Apply for jobs that you are not fully qualified for.

## Making your own luck

Many jobs today have not existed 10 years ago. The rate of change of technology forces us to adapt and look for new opportunities.

### Look beyond the job title

Have a mission and look for opportunities to work on that matters. Job titles are traps that do not enable you to do meaningful work.

### Explore new technologies with enthusiasm

Technologies you will use will probably not be invented/available today. Explore new ways to use beneficial new technologies.

### Make a habit of helping other people

Helping our peers, colleagues and allies should be a regular habit and its own reward.

### Be proactive about taking on new responsibilities / projects

You will not get new challenges if you keep your head down and follow the rules.

### Cultivate your "luck"-quotient by staying open and alert

Lucky people take advantage of chance occurences that come their way. They pay attention to what is happening around them and are able to extract greater value from each situation.

Lucky people are willing to to things outside the usual experience. The are open to interact with people that are different from themselves

## Always be asking "what is next?"

Without knowing and moving towards a goal you do not go anywhere.
