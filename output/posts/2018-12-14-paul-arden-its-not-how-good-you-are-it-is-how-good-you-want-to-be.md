can you improve grammar and tone of the following text
Probably one of the best books ever created.

>
> Paul Arden

## **Chapter 1: The Fundamentals**

### "The world needs mediocrity and not excellence"

- So why do we want to be excellent? You do not do it for the client, you do it for **yourself**.
- "_All creative people need something to rebel against_" it gives their lives excitement and makes their clients life exciting.
- "you will become whoever you want to be - it is only a question of ambition."
- "you can achieve the un-achievable. You need to aim beyond of that what you are capable of."
- Make your vision of where you want to be a reality - disregard where your abilities end.

### People who did great in school do not succeed - they lack the desire to succeed.

Conventional intelligence gives you jobs where you have to display past qualifications are more important. Than how to succeed in the future.

Energy is 75% of the job - if you do not have it, be nice.

Do not seek praise, **seek criticism** - Frankly the only thing wrong with this statement is that you need to be a very confident person. However there is nothing wrong with becoming a very confident person.

**Take responsibility for your actions**, do not invent reasons for why the project is failing > there are no excuses.

### **Give away everything you know, and more will come back to you**

**Do not look for the next opportunity - the one you have is the opportunity**  
you will never get a perfect client. Whatever you do do the best possible. At least you get the satisfaction that you did your best.  
**Dramatize the Positive. Eliminate the Negative.**

Do not promise what you cannot deliver -> If you blow it nobody will trust you.

## Reputation is your most important asset.

Guard it closely.

### Do not take No for an answer

if the client does not buy then you did your job wrong. Improve your product and try again.

Know your clients aims. Sometimes there are not always what they seem. If your client does not buy - do it his way then do it your way.

### When it cannot be done - do it.

If you don't do it it does not exist

### If you cannot solve a the problem, its because you are playing by the rules

A person that does not make mistakes has probably not made anything. Do not be afraid of silly ideas.

## Give yourself a spin (Self-promotion)

it is important to display and present yourself as an expert in your specific field. Buisness cards should dramatize and emphasize this fact.

"Its not what you know - it is who you know." - Networking has become more important then ever.

## Don't give a speech put on a show

### Doing a Layout is having an Idea

put into the planning phase the same amount of intensity as working on the actual idea. Rough Layouts sell the idea better then a polished final idea. The client usually still has time to work with you on the specifics and because he is involved he feels better.

Do not be afraid to work with the best

Do not only stay in your specialized field look also for other things going on in the world.

Do not try to win awards. They will give them to you if your work is great.

## We are all in advertising - it is a part of life.

> Success is going from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm

> Winston Churchill

The first thing to decide before you walk into any negotiations is what to do if the other fellow says no.

There are no shortcuts to any place worth going

What the mind can conceive the mind can achieve

If everything seems under control you're not going fast enough

To become a champion, fight one more round

We do not see things as they are. We see them as we are.
