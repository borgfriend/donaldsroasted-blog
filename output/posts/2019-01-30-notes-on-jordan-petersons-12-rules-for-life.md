I must say I had some difficulties reading this book. The book is a collection of many different very interesting stories of Jordan Petersons life. In a way it reads like a mini autobiography and the lessons Peterson learns/teaches from them. - It is just not the style of book that I like.

Now here and then there are fascinating stories of interpretations of bible texts and core moments you find in movies.

> Stand up straight with your shoulders back.

> Rule 1 - Jordan Peterson

This is the core message of the book. Take responsibility of your life. Walk through life, because life has a meaning. - and be a good person on the way. Be as truthful as possible. Speech and words have immense meaning. - and always keep learning from other people.

So toughen up, be responsible and do something with your life.
