Over the last two months, I have been thinking about this sentence. I am rather fascinated that the sentence is so simple, true, and in a way so trivial that it borders on meaningless.

**Professionals think about all facets of the project, pull through the fun and the boring parts, and finish it correctly.**

However, the thing that I thought was really interesting that Seth Godin, a brilliant bestselling author on business-related topics wrote this sentence. In his blog post gave it minimal context to say professionals use this same type of thinking when approaching their own projects. - The fact alone that he wrote this sentence elevated the sentence and gave it an additional value.

Now let's say, Jamie Oliver, a brilliant cook, would have said the same sentence (and probably he has said it in some form or another already) - I would have dismissed it - I would have been listening on the great meal that Jamie Oliver created and not a philosophical aspect of how this all could apply to my professional life.

This simple sentence, in the end, has made me aware of how I read certain authors and how I change focus depending on the author / the subject that I am reading. As well as adjusting my processes to avoid seeing the boring parts and the fun parts of a task as two separate tasks. Ensuring that I actually pull through the entire project.
