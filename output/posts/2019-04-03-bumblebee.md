I finally got around to watch Bumblebee and I must say I am impressed. It actually had a fun story. The only real flaw was actually that they connected it to the existing Transformers movies (which really did not make any sense at all).

Besides that, awesome robot designs based on the comics. And finally somebody said: "We should not trust them, they literally call themselfs Decepticons."

Overall however it was a fun and entertaining time. Not rocking the boat, but that is ok. It has a wonderful comprehensive story compared to the mess of the last 5 Transformer movies.
