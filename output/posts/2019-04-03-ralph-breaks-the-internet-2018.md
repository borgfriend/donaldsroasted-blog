The trailer looks so super bad. It could be the next Emoji Movie. All of the references will be very dated in the future.

I really did not like the movie. While it does have a couple of good messages for boys and girls in the movie. It just did not work for me.

The only thing that I thought was really awesome that they got all the Disney Princesses together. That was a fun gag and they really all together save the day in the end and whoever animated that part really took full advantage of all the specific traits of each individual princess - that was just wonderful.
