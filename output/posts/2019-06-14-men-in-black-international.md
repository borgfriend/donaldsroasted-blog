Trailer Men in Black

The first Men in Black created a very interesting world. Sadly the producers only create sequels with the same base plot.

There is a lot to like about the movie. Agent M and Agent H are fun to watch, just they do not have anything to do. There are a lot of setups in the movie, but then in the second act they are forgotten and in the third act new things are set up and resolved.

In the end the movie could have been very interesting but it fell flat.
