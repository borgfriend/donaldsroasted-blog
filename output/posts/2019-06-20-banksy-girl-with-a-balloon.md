can you improve grammar and tone of the following text
The "girl with a ballon" is a mural created by Banksy. It is a girl whose heart shaped ballon is carried away by the wind. In essence the girl has lost something beautiful. It is just within her grasp, there is hope she still can catch it.

Then a print of the mural was sold at an auction. The buyer wanted to buy a beautiful print. However in the moment the buyer could have held the print in his hand it was shredded. In essence the buyer has become the girl in the image he lost something beautiful.

However in reality the entire event was to display the absurdity of the art world. The buyer was probably not buying the art for its beauty or meaning, it was probably thought of a nice financial investment tool or going to be used for tax deduction purposes. The beauty of a piece is really not that important. It is only important that the item is unique. If the shredded painting is sold again, the price would be a multiple of the original bid. - In essence by destroying the artwork it has become more valuable - this would not be the case with any other object you would buy. Thus making art auctions very absurd in their nature.

The "shredded girl with a ballon" however also encapsulates the current culture, where one of the major aspects of it is the "live-event" where owning a music album is not important however attending the concert has gained much more importance. It was not about the static long living painting, instead it was all about a single moment in time. The moment in the auction was orchestrated in a way to utilize the maximum of emotional impact. The amazement of the staggering high bid contrasted with the horror of the destruction of the item immediately after. Ending with hope, as the heart shaped ballon survived - enforcing the original text found near murals "there is always hope". The art auction itself became a form of artistic expression and in addition never before an artwork destroyed itself at an auction and as such it got worldwide attention.

In the end the shredder did not shred the entire image. the ballon was unharmed. So you could interpret it that Banksy is still hoping that art auctions become less absurd and focus again on the beauty and meaning of great art pieces and make the world a better place.

Whatever his real intentions were, this elevated Banksy from one of the greatest artists of our time to one of the grandmasters that will be talked and thought about for centuries - or of course Banksy is just a punk kid that is trolling the art world.
