Spiderman: Far From Home had one job to do answer the question: Is there a MCU after the bittersweet end of Avengers: Endgame? - The answer is yes. And it just moves on and gives us a great Spiderman story.

The elementals are probably one of the most interesting villians of the MCU. In their nature they have a small backstory and a bad motivation to take over earth. - Basically rethreading a lot of the previous villians. And then they make them multilayered and transform them into something much more interesting than we have seen for a long time in the MCU...

They pulled it of, a real epilogue to Avengers: Endgame and a gigantic launch point for the next years of the MCU.
