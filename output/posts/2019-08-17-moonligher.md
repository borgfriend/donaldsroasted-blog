I really like the games from 11bit studios... Moonlighter is a fun rougelike game where you your dayjob is to sell stuff while during the night you loot dungeons.

The game is in a beautiful pixel art style and every dungeon is randomly generated. The end boss of every dungeon is quite challenging. (However the desert boss is extraordinarily difficult - sadly even more difficult then the Endboss of the game.

From the mechanics the game has a couple of flaws, like you can enchant your weapon multiple times, but not the first time - There are more than health potions - I totally missed that up until the end of the game, however you will only need health potions. - Broken weapons can be found, but cannot be repaired etc.

Storywise there is a nice buildup to that something greater is going on... but the payoff is rather strange...

As every Dungeon Crawler it has a old man that you just want to punch in the face that just babbles on how dangerous it is and you are going to die...

Overall it was great that it was for free on the Epic Game store - and you can have a lot of fun with this little game.
