## Jan 16: Bad Boys for Life

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKCj3XuPG8M

The second sequel to a movie that did not need a sequel

The original Bad Boys was a great movie, it jumpstarted Will Smiths movie career.

The second movie was Michael Bay exploring the most extreme version of a "Michael Bay" movie. It was loud and stupid, and had a lot of Bayham.

However Bad Boys 3 while featuring the same actors, Bay is not returning to this movie. So it probably will suck. - Got to see it anyway just for the nostalgia factor...

## Jan 30: Dolittle

Well a movie that probably did not have to be remade - but looks awesome.

## Feb 2: Birds of Prey : The Emancipation of Harley Quinn

Would be awesome if it is a anti-wonder woman movie. Could be interesting, as DC is finally getting on track to create better movies.

## Feb 13: The Kings Man: The Beginning

After a couple of stupid decisions made in Kingsman 2 (i.e. killing all kingsman agents) - we are getting a prequel - whoohoo.

Kingsman was awesome, Kingsman 2 was great, looking forward to this one.

## Feb 20: Sonic

When you have to redesign your main character because the internet revolts will probably still not make a passable movie...

## Pixar: Onward

A roadtrip movie from Pixar? Ok, why not.
