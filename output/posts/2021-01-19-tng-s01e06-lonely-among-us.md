While overall the episode is rather meh, it does something quite small that will have long lasting effects.

Data is introduced to the stories of Sherlock Holmes. This subplot is brilliantly executed and will give us more stories in the future.

The story with the energy being and the diplomatic delegates from planets eating each other is, just well random aliens without a lot of substance...
