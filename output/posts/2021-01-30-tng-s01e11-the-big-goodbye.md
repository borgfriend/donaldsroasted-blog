This is a monumental episode, it is the first full holodeck episode - and it has all the core tropes:

- Safety Protocols are disabled and somebody almost dies
- The holodeck malfunctions
- Some random historic setting that we will never see again

In this episode the meeting room scene is excellent... Picard totally forgot the meeting, accidentally asks Beverly out for a date, immediately ruins it by inviting additional friends.

Overall the story is not great... but it is the first introduction to the Holodeck and it is nice how much effort they put into the old style and costumes.
