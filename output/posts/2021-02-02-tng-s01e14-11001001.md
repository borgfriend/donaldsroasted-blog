Another incredible episode of TNG.

It explores the Holodeck a little more and what could happen when you simulate a very realistic person based on subconcious desires of a human.

It asks the question of what would happen when a species is completely dependent on computer technology - and the technology is going to fail.

And it even explores Data further, does he have the ability to create a painting? And puts in the first seeds of the Jordy Data friendship - as "A blind person, teaches an android to paint"- as Riker remarks.

And it is wrapped in an excellent story of a simple computer upgrade, that turns into stealing a starship, kidnapping the captain and Riker.

These are the episodes where every character shines, and you just want more of these excellent stories.
