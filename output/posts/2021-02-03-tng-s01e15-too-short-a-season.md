can you improve grammar and tone of the following text
Well and again we are at the bottom of the barrel... A corrupt crazy Admiral that takes a youth potion to try to fix a mistake he did 45years ago... The episode is a drag, and has a lot of filler scenes to make the episode longer.

While the episode does show a small little crack in the ideal Federation, the episode does not take a closer look at the possibility that the Federation has any flaws at all.
