The Next Generation is finding itself. All actors are starting to become the beloved characters we know today.

  
At the core of this episode are a couple of fascinating Science-Fiction concepts. It looks at the possibility and difficulties of terraforming a planet.  

The episode starts out with a simple murder of a crew member of the terraforming expedition. However, the episode then explores the difficulties of defining what a life-form is. The enterprise crew then discovers a new life-form â€“ that tries to take over the ship.

  
There is a scene where they discuss if the thing that they found actually fits the definition of a life-form. During this discussion, the thing starts demonstrating the minimum life-form requirements.  
Sadly the entire murder subplot is filler around the more interesting life-form discussion. But the story structure is better compared to the previous episodes.

## Exercise of the day:
