We get to look into the Klingon culture. â€“ It is an action-packed episode with responding to a distress call. Then discovering that the survivors are Klingon terrorists. A brief kidnapping situation, which was a misunderstanding. Leading to a prison escape, dead crew members, and a showdown in the Engine room.  
It is an interesting action episode that gives a little insight into the Klingon culture.
