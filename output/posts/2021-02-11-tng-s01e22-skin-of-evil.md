Well, this is the episode that Tasha dies. The sad part of the episode is that we really never got to know who Tasha is. The tar monster just kills her for no reason - however, she does get a nice funeral.

Not sure what to say about this episode, it's an episode about an evil tar monster. As data points out "Without any redeeming qualities". The enterprise puts a warning beacon out and destroys the shuttle that the tar cannot leave the planet.
