I guess this is a romantic episode? We get to see Picard encounter his fiancee he dumped to go to starfleet. Besides that some Dimensional TIme thing that is solved by data...

I would say it is an episode to skip. The only thing relevant is that Picard mentions in a sentence that he has an artificial heart, which will be relevant in season 6.
