Oh well, the enterprise flies into a hole. An alien plays with the enterprise as if it would be a mouse in an experiment.

Nobody would believe they would self destruct the enterprise in the second episode. Overall the episode was rather bland without a lot to say on the topic of death. Picard outsmarts the alien, thats nice...
