Star Wars meets Star trek. We get to meet Okona, a rogue like character, flying around with an old ship. And what a guy, he manages to seduce 3 women in like half a day.

Data in this episode explores 'Humor' - that was probably not the best at the time, and it has not aged very well.

Okona is then accused by two planets that he is a criminal, for one he impregnated the princess and on the other he stole a jewel. - An ah just like every other rogue like character he has a heart of gold and he was just helping out the couple in their inerplanetary romeo and juliet.

The episode is ok... but it is also quite skippable.
