The episode highlights and embraces the unique skills and competencies that people with disabilities can bring to society. Reva is deaf - so he has a choir of three people that communicate with him telepathically. During a peace talk, the choir gets killed and he has to accept and embrace his disability.

He manages to take his disadvantage and turn it into an advantage in the peace talks moving forward.

It is a great story where it seems possible that everyone can co-exist and that conflicts can be resolved by using diplomacy and good communication and mutual understanding are key to everything.
