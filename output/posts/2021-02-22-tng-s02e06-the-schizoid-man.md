Ah, the dream of immortality - A scientist puts his mind into the body of data... but in the end has to discover that immortality is not for him.  
The episode is rather sloppy. The scientist could build a similar android and uploaded his brain to that body. Data would then only have served as a temporary vessel.  
This concept is incredible and could be explored much deeper. The movie "Chappie", while weird, looks at this a little deeper, or the Amazon Comedy Series "Upload". Voyager will revisit this concept when the Doctor takes control of 7 of 9's body.  
Maybe the story at the time was revolutionary... and it inspired many spinoffs of this concept. The idea of immortality is always a wish of man.
