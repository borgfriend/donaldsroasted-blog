## What is the 10x Rule?

People underestimate the time needed to get to be successful. You have to put in a lot of thought and action to get anywhere. If you put in an average amount of effort you may get less than an average amount of success. You have to adjust your thinking so that you dare to dream at levels previously unimaginable.  
"Only you can know your true potential and if you are living up to it"  
Success is like air, your last breath is not as important as the next breath that you take.

Highly successful people continue to be successful, produce more even if they seem that they do not have to anymore. They continue to push because that effort must continue to accomplish new achievements.

The disappointment of the current moment is not that something is wrong, but something is right. Because there is a desire to change something.

Never limit your desire for success. You will fail if you make your targets easier to reach. Because then the target does not matter and you put in even less effort.  
Basic failure to achieve a goal:

1. **Mistargeting** - the objective is too low, not the correct amount of motivation
2. **Underestimating Effort** - It needs a lot of energy and resources to accomplish your goal
3. **Competing in your sector** - Instead, Dominate your sector
4. **Underestimating the amount of adversity needed to overcome** - to actually attain their goal

Many have been programmed to set targets that are not even by their own design. Our notions about what is possible, fair, morally good, bad, ugly, what looks good, etc.  
Any goal is difficult to achieve, and there are disappointments on the way.  
Setting goals too low and hitting them, and then are shocked that you still did not get what you wanted. If you try to achieve the 'unrealistic' goals, even when you come up short you still have achieved something.  
In order to be successful, you need to keep success. Losing 10 pounds and gaining 12 is not considered a success.  
**The 10x rule is about what you have to think and do to get to a point 10x more gratifying than you have ever imagined.**

## Why the 10x Rule is Vital

Unexpected things happen, almost every project is underestimated.  
A major mistake is you should never cross your mind to reduce a target. - _Never reduce a target, increase Actions._ Any target is attainable with persistence and the right amount of actions.  
We are fed with a lot of excuses, instead of taking responsibility and action. We want to blame failure on everything else except on our activity level (amount of actions we took)  
In order to pitch your idea to one person. Try to invite 10 people, and when you are lucky you will get one person.  
Do not be pessimistic, be prepared. Attack everything with the ferocity of a champion athlete, getting his last chance to be in the history books. - Make no excuses and adopt an "in it to win it whatever it takes" attitude.  
Success does not just happen, it is a series of actions taken over time. Getting lucky is part of it - But the more actions you take the better the chances are of getting "lucky".

## What is Success?

The definition of success changes based on your life condition. It can be found anywhere

1. Success is important
2. It is your moral duty to be successful
3. There is no shortage of success (If you are successful you do not take that away from another)

Success is critical. **If you quit caring, then you quit winning.** Nobody benefits from your failure.

## Success is your duty

As soon as you make this mind-shift and see it as your own moral duty, an ethical responsibility - you will stop lying to yourself and start making the adjustments to ensure success.

## Assume Control of Everything

Success is not something that happens to you - you create success, it is because of the actions that you take.  
Do not blame as a reason why something happened or did not happen. Whether you were in control or not take responsibility of the situation.  
If there is a power outage, yes that was not under your control. You could have prepared with a backup generator. Blaming does not help in the situation. It is your responsibility to find a solution to get out of the situation.

## Four degrees of action

Disciplined constant action is much better. The more action you take the more likely you are to hit it big.  
There are 4 choices for action:

1. Do nothing.
2. Retreat.
3. Take normal levels of action
4. Take massive action

## Doing Nothing

People that do nothing have given up on their dreams. They are willing to accept whatever comes their way. Signs that you are doing nothing include exhibiting boredom, lethargy, and lack of purpose.  
Doing nothing actually takes a lot of energy. It takes work to be overlooked for a promotion, it takes work to explain yourself, it takes creativity and energy. It confuses friends and family when you say you are happy - but it is obvious that you are not living up to your potential.

### Retreaters

People who retreat take a lot of energy to explain why they retreat. They face a little bit of hardship and then they take the opposite action and give up on improving.

### Normal Levels of action

Take enough actions that are necessary. this is a dangerous path as this leads to the 'middle class' you have just enough. They end up being average, and by definition, the average is less than ordinary.  
Minor life events can throw you off balance because you were doing enough and now are under stress due to the unexpected additional burden.  
Nobody desires average. The average is the most dangerous level. As average is accepted by society. This is not enough to catapult you to success.

### Massive Action

This is actually the natural state of action for all of us. Children are always in action. It is only that other adults start telling you to take less action.  
When you take massive action, you are not thinking about how many hours you work. It is treating success as a duty. It is the only thing that matters.  
People may call you a workaholic, obsessive, greedy - whatever this comes only from people that are only taking normal levels of action - the social norm. People will criticize you to justify that there is nothing wrong with them.  
It will not come from people that are also successful they know that this is the level you have to operate on.  
Even managers may try to discourage you. You know you are stepping into the realm of massive action when 1. you are starting to create new problems for yourself. and 2 get criticism from others.  
No one is going to come to your house and make your dreams come true. You must take massive action. It is important to dominate your domain. Taking massive action will break you through obscurity, increase your value in the marketplace and help you generate success in any area you elect.

## 10X Goals

If goals are important you should write them down every day. And choose objectives out of reach.  
To get through the resistance you need a big goal to get there. - The more unrealistic they are but they are aligned to your purpose and duty you will get there and you will be energized to get there.  
Setting realistic goals will give you a realistic life. This is based on what others have built for themselves.  
Notice another thing about setting goals. You are setting them for yourself, not for anyone else. Anything is possible, You have more potential than you realize, no matter what the goal it will require work.

## Dominate your sector

Forward thinkers do not copy  
Apple does not compete, it dominates its markets.  
Never play by the established rule

## Obsession

Obsession is a good thing, everyone that is successful is obsessed with something. It only has a negative connotation.

### Time Management

You have to take a look at all the small things in your day that may be wasteful. Prioritize exactly what you want to accomplish.

## Criticism is a Sign of Success

When people start criticizing, then this is a signal of success. You are being recognized. People will always try to bring you down. But for that, you have to be someone first.  
Real feedback, like complaints about your product - is a gift. You can use that to improve your product.

## Omnipresence

Your goal must be to be like Coca-Cola, Apple, etc. Everybody should know who you are. Everybody should know how good you are. As soon as everyone knows your name your business will explode. Write blog posts, Twitter, Facebook, etc. use social media to be known.

## Conclusion

The book inspires you to take action and control your life. It is a nice inspirational read, in the middle it's slightly a drag, but it ends on a high note that the author expects that you will now take action. - But in the end, it is the responsibility of the reader to do something.
