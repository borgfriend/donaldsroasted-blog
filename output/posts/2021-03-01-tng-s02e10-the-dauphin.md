Ah, to be young and falling in love with an alien... This is a Wesley episode where he falls in love with a shapshifting alien.

I think it is great, how the writers presented very different styles of flirting, from the raw Klingon roar to the over-the-top Riker maneuver 'You are the most beautiful woman in the galaxy". Wesley gets the girl and but the girl has to save her home planet and it does not work out. Guinan is there to comfort him. A wonderful ending for the episode
