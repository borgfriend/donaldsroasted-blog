What an episode, we get started by the destruction of a Galaxy class ship, Romulans are nearby, and a mysterious ancient artifact from a lost but advanced society.

Will the Enterprise be next? The episode depicts a classic computer virus. It transmits itself unknowingly to the Enterprise and to the Romulan ship. The solution for the problem is also just like with a computer virus. Turn off the computer, restore it from a backup, and restart. - That is quite impressive considering computers were not yet common and not many computer viruses existed at the time.

It also alludes to a more advanced Iconian alien civilization that would make travel by spaceships unneeded, just walk through the StarGate. But we can't destroy the premise of the entire series - so let's quickly blow up the planet.
