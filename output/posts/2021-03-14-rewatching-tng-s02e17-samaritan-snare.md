What an episode, following the Borg, the enterprise meets a ship of stupid people that you have to wonder that they ever got into space in the first place. We meet the Pakled - a race that still needs to evolve intelligence. So they just steal from the smart people.

Captain Picard has to get a medical procedure and Wesley has to take an exam. They both fly in a shuttle and have a couple of really incredible scenes. There is a scene where Picard lectures Wesley on the importance of Art, Philosophy and History

_"Did you read that book I gave you?" - "Some of it" - "That is reassuring" - "I don't have too much time" - "There is no greater challenge than the study of philosophy" "But William James will not be on my exams." - "**The important things never will be**, anyone can be trained in the mechanics of piloting a starship" - "But star fleet academy" - "Takes more"_

"_Open your mind to the past. Art, history, philosophy. And all this may mean something..._"-Â **Picard**, giving Wesley Crusher advice

In this episode, Picard also tells the story of his encounter with the Nausicans and how he lost his heart, with will come back in the incredible episode "Tapestry".

And we never heard of the Pakled again... until the final episode of Star Trek: Lower Decks...

In the end this is an episode about the dangers of falling for scams and that you should be aware that there are always scammers in the universe. It is also that stupid people sometimes use intelligent people to advance their own agenda.
