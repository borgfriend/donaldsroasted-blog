This is a weird episode. Lwaxana Troi comes for a visit and tries to seduce Captain Picard. She apparently is in a phase where she has an extreme sex drive and is looking for another man. The entire episode is Picard avoiding her advances.

In the episode, it is suggested that her "telepathic abilities" are impaired due to her condition. However, at the end of the episode, she demonstrates that she is in full control and very advanced in her abilities. Suggesting that she is can read Picard but for some reason, he does not act on his desires (which is never explained).

The episode also introduces some fish aliens that explore a little how humans react and avoid alien things. That we do not have to be afraid of foreign cultures. Just to flip it and say, gotcha they were assassins and wanted to kill everyone. So I guess do have some precautions?

If you like Lwaxana episodes, you are going to have a good time. If not you can skip the episode.
