Well apparently we are continuing an exploration of mating techniques. This week we will take a look at Klingon culture. The premise is simple, an old sleeper warship is returning to attack the Federation. They are unaware that there is peace between the Federation and the Klingon Empire.

Let's step back a little and think about this. The Klingons just assumed that the war will continue for 100 years and additionally will need a random sleeper cell attacking random targets - 'just in case'. Not sure - but I would rather presume that a warship during wartime would have more strategic use in the current war. But no idea - i guess the Klingons think long term.

The Enterprise has to pick up the emissary - apparently Worfs old Flame. While they had a falling out they get cozy quite fast. Resulting in a clash of Klingon traditions vs Modern approaches to sexuality. basically Worf wants to get married and she sees it more like an one night stand.

Old ideas will always clash with modern approaches. The old Klingons could never imagine peace with the Federation, while modern Klingons see the Federation as an ally.

Worf then comes up with an idea how they can avoid destroying the attacking Klingon ship. He creates a version of events that would work in the eyes of the old tradition. He takes command of the enterprise and it appears that the Klingons have won the war. As that was the only honorable thing to do.

In the end Worf does not marry his girl. Traditions change over time and every generation has to pick and choose which traditions they continue to honor.
