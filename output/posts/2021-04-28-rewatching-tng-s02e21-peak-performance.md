A brilliant episode, where everyone shines, works together and are truly at their 'peak performance'.

The game is simple, Riker gets an old ship and should engage the Enterprise in combat. He is allowed to select his crew and they get to work. An alien master strategist is going to observe the game.

Before the game, Data is defeated by the alien in a board game and is having a crisis if he is malfunctioning.

Picard has to build up his confidence again. Even Polaski and Troi have a couple of good likeable scenes.

While Riker fixes up the old ship, Wesley and Jordi create a solution to engage the old Warp drive. Worf uses a couple of Klingon sensor tricks to fool the enterprise to see a Romulan Bird of prey.

This however will cause Picard to make a wrong decision when a real Ferengi ship approaches and fires on the Enterprise.

They quickly come up with an unorthodox strategy to convince the Ferengi to leave them alone.

Then Data gets his rematch, and utterly defeats the Alien at the board game.

It's a brilliant piece of how to analyse, plan, anticipate movements of others, and everyone working together as a team. And of course the Ferengi that do not completely understand the importance of regular exercise.

You really get the taste of past experiences how they influence your current performance and the importance of not giving up and working hard to achieve seemingly impossible goals - and if they are impossible, maybe approach it with an unorthodox strategy.
