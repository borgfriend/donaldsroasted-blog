## Exercise Program

I was on a short vacation, so the exercise program got a little bit reduced and interrupted my schedule for a while and it took some time to get back into the routine.

However now for season 3: the plan is a morning exercise, and an evening exercise. Additionally I will be focusing on better nutrition.

Instead of spending time thinking about it I am going to use a food box service. This forces me to reduce my portion size and at the same time increase my consumption of vegetables and reduce my consumption of meats.
