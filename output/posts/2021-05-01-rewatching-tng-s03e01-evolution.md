Wesley apparently was so bored by the last clipshow episode that he fell asleep. He was experimenting with Nanomachines. He added a couple of parameters and whoops he created a new lifeform. That starts eating up the computer of the enterprise.

Wesley is put into contrast with an Dr Stubs, that was once a Wunderkind and his entire life he worked on an experiment that is only possible once every 200 years.

Interestingly they already hint at the Borg in this episode, I wonder if it is going to be important by the end of the season...

Overall it is an exploration how an encounter with a new lifeform can playout, and the miscommunications that can happen between two species meeting for the first time.

Additionally it looks at how 'living up to your potential' can be a curse, and a burden.

They do not really go into the ramifications of 'accidently creating a new lifeform', the nanites just get their own home planet.

Overall a very strong first episode.
