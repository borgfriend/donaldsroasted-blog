The Federation is friendly with everyone... but some aliens do not want to deal with these lower life forms. These aliens detected a settlement on one of their planets and asked the federation to remove the settlement again.

Turns out the settlement was undetected for over 80 years - due to radiation or whatever, Data is the only one that can go down to the planet to start the evacuation.

The entire piece is a very interesting take on how societies react to a threat, and how Data could not persuade the people of the threat, only when he started to destroy things the people wanted to protect the people agreed to leave the settlement.

Picard also manages to extend the time, by finding a legal loophole in the contract with the aliens... so i guess interpreting legalese is still a mess in the future...
