The enterprise responds to a distress call - when they arrive the entire planet is destroyed - with the exception of a sweet old couple and their house.

In this episode Picard shines as he analyses the situation, and they find out the horrific truth what actually happened on this planet.

In the end Picard concludes he really is not in the position to make any judgement and just leaves the alien alone.

It is rather an odd episode, as the alien clearly has unlimited powers, but is really sloppy using them. (i.e. evading the enterprise) - The alien choose to be a pacifist and then commited genocide.

There is not much to learn from this episode, except that there are going to be aliens out there that have limitless powers that we cannot control or judge their actions.

Overall interesting story, and one of the few stories where the enterprise while doing everything right - ultimatly cannot do anything at all to resolve or improve the situation.

In the end this scene from the episode sums it up quite nicely: Worf as he drinks tea:”Well, what do you think, Mr. Worf?” - ”Good tea. (Looks around) Nice house.”
