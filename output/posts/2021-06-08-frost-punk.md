City simulators are usually not my thing. They are endless games without any real end goal. - Frost Punk changes the concept. You have a generator and a couple of survivors. Your task is simple - survive.

## GamePlay

The basic gameplay is simple:

- manage resources (for construction, keeping the generator alive, keeping the people alive)
- manage people (housing, medical, other) Your main task is to balance these two areas - Nothing special here.

However, the game does something brilliant. It adds a legal system - you have to pass laws that change which abilities you have. These laws are moral/ethical choices that will significantly impact your colony. Which buildings can be built, the satisfaction of your population.  
Each choice has its tradeoff, major positive effects but also negative effects. For example, you can choose to become a pure faith-based colony - your population will never lose hope. The cost? exile the non-believers that they freeze to death in the cold.

## Story Mode

The game wants to tell the story of the survivors, and there are several game events that change and impact the game situation.  
The brilliance is that, even if you choose to avoid the negative story beats. You cannot avoid them, and you will have to deal with the problems.  
You grow along with your colony and you try to protect it from the cold. And even when you are floating far above the colony and your population is just a statistic, due to the animation and the crowd movement you are somehow connected with your freezing colony.

## Why should you play the game?

The fascinating thing about this game is that you make ethical & moral decisions. You have to then deal with the long-term effects of that decision. You can learn something about yourself. You can reconsider what hard choices you would make, what is important to you and how you perceive the real world.
