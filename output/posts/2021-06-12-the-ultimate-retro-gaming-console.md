Originally I only wanted to play an old SNES Game on my couch, I could not get the thing running with my Smart TV. I looked into how to emulate the game on the TV and stumbled upon one of the greatest and most interesting Retro gaming projects ever.

There is a Plugin for Media Center Application Kodi called the "Internet Archive Gaming Launcher" (IAGL) . The Launcher solves two major problems with retro console gaming.

1. It downloads and installs the needed emulator
2. It lists all available Roms for a very large range of retro consoles.
3. It even goes a step beyond and lists modded Roms

Finally it has a beautifully user experience - that when you want to play something, it is just two clicks away.

**Note**: The legality of downloading ROMs is still being debated. https://www.howtogeek.com/262758/is-downloading-retro-video-game-roms-ever-legal/

## 1\. Step: Get the Hardware

For my setup I choose the following Hardware. (Of course - you can skip this step and just install Kodi on your Windows/Mac/Linux PC)

### Amazon - Fire TV 4k Stick

The Amazon Fire TV stick is a wonderful media device. It is very easy to setup and use (For Netflix, Disney and Amazon Prime Video).

The Fire Stick runs Android - Thus you can install any Android application on it.

**Note**: You can use a different device as well. You can install Originally I was using the Raspberry Pi 3 for my setup - However I had difficulties pairing the XBOX One controller and I did not manage to get Netflix to run on it.

### Microsoft - XBox One Controller (Bluetooth)

This is just personal preference, i think the XBOX One Controller is from the design and feel a perfect controller.

It pairs without any issues with the Amazon Fire TV.

## 2\. Step: Install Kodi

You can find a full guide with pictures [here](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/how-to-install-kodi-fire-tv,news-25115.html).

1. Go into the Settings > Device > Developer Options > Enable "Apps from Unknown Sources"
2. Download the Program "Downloader"
3. Navigate to the url [](http://www.kodi.tv/download)[http://www.kodi.tv/download](http://www.kodi.tv/download)
4. Install the Android 32-bit version of Kodi

## 3\. Step: Install Internet Archive Gaming Launcher

Github Repo: IAGL (Internet Archive Game Launcher) [](https://github.com/zach-morris/plugin.program.iagl)[https://github.com/zach-morris/plugin.program.iagl](https://github.com/zach-morris/plugin.program.iagl)

The first step of the installation may be tricky, but you either use the app downloader to save the zip file to the fire stick.

As alternative you set up a Kodi to access a Network drive and download the file there.

In Kodi

1. Go To Setup > Add-Ons â†’ Install from zip file
2. Navigate to the downloaded zip file and install IAGL

## Enjoy!
