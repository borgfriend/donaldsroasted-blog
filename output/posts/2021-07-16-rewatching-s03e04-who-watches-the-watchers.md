This episode is a brilliant piece of science fiction. It explores what would happen when an advanced alien civilization meets an just developing civilization.

This episode is a must watch and really explores a lot of ideas about religion, technology and our perspective of the world. Additionally it asks moral implications if a society worships you as gods if you should use that position to guide them.

Interestingly Star Gate SG-1 years later will explore the same question in a totally different way with the Asgard race.
