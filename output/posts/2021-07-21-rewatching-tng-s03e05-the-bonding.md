For a change, an away mission goes bad and a woman gets killed by an ancient booby trap. The tragedy is that she leaves behind a now orphaned teenage son.  
The aliens responsible for the trap want to make things better. They send a member to try to comfort and adopt the child. The Alien pretends to be the killed woman and tries to convince the boy to stay on the planet.  
At the same time, Worf thinks he is responsible and also wants to take care of the child.  
The episode tries to deal with the difficult topic of death.  
There is a great conversation between Data and Riker, where Data questions why we do not equally mourn the loss of those we are close to and those we are not. It ends with Riker saying that if we mourned all loss of life equally, humans would have a much less bloody past.  
We cannot ignore death. We cannot live in the past. We have to find acceptance of our mortality and our loved ones. And in the end, we have to bond with other living people to overcome our loss and support each other.  
The more indirect question of course is, if single parents should serve in the military and take the risk of orphaning their children
