The Wish Dragon is a cute little tale of a boy wanting to get his friend back. It's the classical Aladdin story told in a chinese setting. Overall a cute story.

You can watch it here: https://www.netflix.com/title/81153694

There was one small element of the story that I really liked. The 'teapot' was created by a god that the person learns a lesson about life.

This god when he is on earth appears to be a crazy old man. Which is quite interesting idea. As you can interpret this that anyone, especially the crazy people could be a god and you should treat them with kindness and respect.
