A wormhole is discovered, and a couple of factions meet to figure out who is going to control it. Sadly the episode is also a 'romance' / Troi gets manipulated story.

The episode explores how in such a trade negotiation various manipulation techniques are used. Every alien race tries to gain the upper hand using the 'legal' and 'illegal' methods. The Ferengi try to poison the other negotiators. The Federation gains 'trust' by being the neutral party that invites to the conference. And other alien species send out a mind reader to conduct their business for them (basically espionage).

In the end the wormhole is not stable and the Ferengi get stuck in the Delta Quadrant. This gets later explored in Voyager.

There is a certain parallel to the first episode of Deep Space Nine where they also discover and take control of the wormhole, and how this discovery will fundamentally change the importance of the region of space.
