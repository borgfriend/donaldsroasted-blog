The enterprise encounters an ancient trap that siphons off energy from the enterprise so it cannot leave. Jordi creates a Hologram of the Designer of the Enterprise Engines to make the modifications to the engine that they can escape.

One of the more interesting things this episode touches upon is that dating in the future for nerds is just as hard as today.

The computer accidently creates the Hologram of the original designer, Jordi then requests to recreate her personality as well based on her public appearances. Considering that we currently have the technology to create deep fake images it is not far off that something like this could be feasible in the future. The episode does not really touch on the moral problems it creates (but luckily they return to this in a future episode).

Jordi falls for the Holodeck, but is mature enough to end the program and recognize it as just an illusion.

Oddly it displays that love relationships in the future will be the same as today, even though these relationships are constantly changing and adjusting.

It's a little sad that the episode did not explore more the ideas how technology would impact dating rituals. But I guess since it is seen as something biological we tend to not think about it how Tech influences and changes dating culture.
