Well when tribes have blood oaths to destroy another tribe, combined with genetics and desperation - results in a very weird star trek episode.

In a sense it is an episode that some people just want to live in the past and continue to wage war - and those people can hinder achieving peace. There is not a lot about healing the wounds and working together - just get rid of the trouble maker, which is sad.
