A Romulan wants to defect to the Federation. Can he be trusted?

This episode explores a couple of problems when people try to defect. The Defector that cannot be trusted, that has his own moral dilemma that he is betraying his own people.

The intentions of the defector were quite nobel he wanted to prevent a war, however he was fed misinformation and all of his efforts were for nothing and he commits suicide. Even his note to his family cannot be delivered as the two parties are not exchanging messages.

Picard is smart enough to not let the enterprise get captured and at the same time prevent a war between the Romulans and the Federation.

At the end of the episode there is still a notion of hope that in the future there will be peace between the federation and the romulan empire.

In this episode we see Romulus for the first time via the Holodeck.
