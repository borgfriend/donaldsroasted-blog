At first glance this episode is an action packed hunt the escaped prisoner. It goes into a lot of technical details on how the enterprise can be outsmarted. The Prisoner even outsmarts Data, puts down misleading signals etc.

In many ways it reminds me of the first Rocky movie. And similar to that movie it is actually about how to treat veterans when they have to reintegrate into society.

It is a very well written episode, and leaves the ending open if the alien race actually will change its ways moving forward.
