And we are moving on to another really depressing topic, last episode we had to deal with Veterans. This week it is the big terrorism question.

The episode takes a look at the immense complexity when dealing with a deeply rooted conflict. It never takes any side if the government or the terrorists. Both sides are already using escalated measures to deal with the situation. It explores how and why terrorism escalates and that there is never a clear and simple answer how to end the conflict that both sides are satisfied.

The episode ends with a glimmer of hope that at least for the moment the killing has stopped. However the conflict has not been resolved.

Overall the episode covers a lot of ground in a very short period of time. It leaves you at least with something to think about.
