A moon is falling uncontrollably on a planet, nothing can stop it - and suddenly Q appears. Stripped from his powers as a 'mere' mortal human, seeking asylum on the enterprise.

While the crew is trying to figure out if Q is just trolling them again. Other aliens try to take advantage of the situation and enact revenge on Q. The overall framing of the episode is rather meh.

The thing that makes this episode really stand out is that Q learns a lot from Data, an Android. It is these two characters that struggle to be humans in two totally different ways that make this episode quite interesting.

Data saves Q life, and in the end Q sacrifices himself to safe the Enterprise. In turn he is restored his powers - saves the planet from the moon and gives Data an incredible gift at the end of the episode. (Sadly ruined by Star trek movies later on)

The episode has it all, a little drama and a lot of lighthearted Q fun.
