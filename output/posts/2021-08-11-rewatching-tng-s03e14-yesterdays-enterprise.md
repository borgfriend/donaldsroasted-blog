Due to a time vortex the Enterprise-C is pulled from the past into the future. Thus the entire timeline changed. The only person that is aware of this change is Guinan.

There is a lot to love about this episode. It shows all the characters what would have happened if they were at war for years instead of living in peace. The importance of small events that can have a significant larger impact on the entire galaxy. And of course Worf is introduced to Prune juice and he loves it.

The episode allows Tasha Yar to get a worthy sendoff and is basically an apology for the random tar monster.

This markes also the first Alternate Reality Enterprise Crew to be encountered. While TNG never visits the Mirror Universe. The Klingon-Federation conflict is going to be the starting point of Star Trek Discovery.

There is also a lot to love about the Enterprise-C Ship Design, a ship that blends design elements of both the Enterprise-A as well as the Enterprise-D. You can easily imagine the progression between the two eras in Startrek.

Overall it is an interesting episode.
