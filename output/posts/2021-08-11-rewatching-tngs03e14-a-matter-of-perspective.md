We get introduced to the episode of a drawing class, where every painter is drawing in a totally different art style. Everybody is seeing the same model from a different perspective.

They then continue to beam Riker on board - but the Space station he was on explodes. Shortly after that he is accused of murder. They use the holodeck to explore what happened, and recreate scenarios based on the various witness testimonies.

Even with advanced technology it may not be that obvious to get to the truth of any situation.

It is a murder-mystery episode. If that is your thing this episode is for you.
