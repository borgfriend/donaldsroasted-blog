Lower Decks Season 1, was unexpectedly good. I was really looking forward to see what will happen next, how Boimler is doing on the Titan, how Mariner will continue to rebel against the status quo. How Tendi and Rutherford will process the events of the Season 1 finale.

The episode starts off with a great Holodeck action piece, filled with tons of great callbacks to the original series. After that the actual episode was sadly not the best.

Mariner wants to do a side quest and clean up the city. This accidentally releases 'strange energies' and Ransom becomes a god.

Meanwhile Tendi thinks its strange that Rutherford 'changed' and likes to eat pears. While she is just jealous that he has a Date. That side plot was kindof fun - until Tendi goes full psycho and hunts Rutherford down with a gun that he has to raise a literal forcefield between them.

Ransom as representation of masculinity - what does he do as a god? He only cares about himself and wants big statues of himself, and everyone should look like him? His needs are portrayed as needy, seeking attention from his captain and overall as pathetic and weak. The writers could have chosen a better path as the two women were making it impossible for him to do his job. However they choose to portray men as unwelcome and unneeded.

Captain Freeman Is about to fix the situation by talking to Ransom. By acknowledging that the relationship between Freeman and Mariner is problematic. That she is neglecting her First Officer and that in any case this nepotism should be addressed. Oh whoops, that did not happen Mariner just repeatedly kicks Rutherford in the balls. - how funny!

At the end of the episode the women were right and did nothing wrong. Zero consequences for Tendis abuse of medical authority over Rutherford. Putting Mariner into a Jail cell is not relevant as at the beginning of the next episode she is not sitting in that cell anymore and will not have learned anything. Everybody is reset to their character development in the beginning of Season 1. Just this time Mariner, continues to be a type of Mary Sue and now is confirmed to be literally mightier than a god.

Hopefully the next episode will be better...
