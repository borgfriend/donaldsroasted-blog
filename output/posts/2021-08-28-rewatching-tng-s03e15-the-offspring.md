This episode is quite interesting... it continues to ask philosophical questions about the nature of Data. In this case is he allowed to procreate... Well Data does not have to ask that question... he just builds himself an offspring.

It is interesting to see the Android starting to learn and adaptËœ. One of the more fascinating aspects of the episode is that the android is allowed to choose its gender. There is a small debate on this subject, as this will influence profoundly the social interactions the Android will experience. The Android chooses to be a female and wants to be called Lal.

The episode then looks into a couple of rather dark ideas. The question "Who is better suited to raise children? The parents or the state?". As an Admiral wants to raise the Android with a team of experienced specialists, vs the original parent that is inexperienced and is raising his first child.

Since Data's child is just seen as an item, as property the Admiral makes the argument that it should be able to take away that item. While naturally Data wants to protect his child and teach her as much as possible, he also is considering what is best for his daughter... Picard also steps in and delays the process as much as possible, defending the rights of the child.

In the end they ask Lal what she wants. She however, as she is an evolution of Data experiences fear and ultimately dies of this trauma. Data downloads her experiences and she 'lives on' in data.

Overall it is an interesting look at the idea how Data could evolve in the future, as well as a strong reminder of the importance of parenthood as well as the danger of an overreaching government.
