Aliens conducting an experiment to explore different styles of how to deal with Authority. For this experiment Picard is kidnapped and put into a cell.

Overall, the idea is quite good, and it explores the different styles quite well.

On the other hand, Picard is replaced, and frankly nobody really notices it - which is strange. Even Beverly that seems to know Picard quite intimate - and that had dinner with the replicate did not notice anything?

But well, who knows, in the end it is a reminder that you should always conduct ethical science experiments.
