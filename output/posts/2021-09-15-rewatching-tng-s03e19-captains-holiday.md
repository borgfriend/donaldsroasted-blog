Well, this episode introduces us to Vash, probably the first human that is not member of Starfleet. It also introduces us to Risa, a paradise/pleasure planet.

The story is nothing special, some treasure map, a ferengi obsessed with treasure, and a couple of time travelers that want to make sure that the treasure is destroyed.

The episode is a fun break from the normal episodes. And a small side adventure for captain Picard.
