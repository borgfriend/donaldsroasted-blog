The federation has made a discovery, a living alien spaceship. The enterprise is given a specialist, a betazoid that is a wunderkind.

At the same time it is a race against the Romulans. Who can get to the ship first?

We get to know the Betazoid and his difficulties to adjust to society because he can hear the thoughts of every living thing in the entire ship. - He bonds with Data, because he cannot hear his thoughts.

The episode takes a couple of nice twists and turns - some action, some philosophy and a compelling story.

It's a wonderful episode where it highlights that everyone has a place in the universe and is important.

Interestingly the concept of a living ship and a captain bound to the ship, is basically the basis of the ship in Farscape.
