This episode introduces us to one of the most magnificent characters ever in star trek. Lt. Barclay - is a little different. He has difficulties to adapt and sees the world entirely differently. He has a lot of imagination but is socially awkward.

It is nice to see how the episode tries to address the problem of mobbing, and how some people like Guinan and Jordi try to help Barclay to integrate better. It has the hope that in the future everyone treats everyone better, and tries to do the best to help people that are different.

While a lot of the episode focuses on Barclays Holodeck addiction and his coping mechanism with reality, it also gives us a moment of pure brilliance of Barclay, where only he with his incredible imagination can solve the problem that almost destroyed the enterprise.
