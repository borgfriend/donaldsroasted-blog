We have here another incredible Data episode. The episode starts with Data appearing to be killed in a shuttle accident. While the crew first has to deal with the loss of Data - of course they find out that he is still alive and rescue him - nothing too special here.

It is nice to see how the various people adjust to the new situation, and how Jordi really cares about his friend. There is also a nice scene with Picard and Jordi, where it is as first business as usual, but Picard is also having his difficulties to deal with the loss of Data.

However the core of the episode is much more interesting. Data was kidnapped by a person named Fajo that collects unique things. A man that has no morals is pitted against Data, that is programmed to value life and always act morally.

Fajo is not a stupid man, he first created a physical trap for Data, he cannot escape his prison. He then wants that Data cooperates and entertains his guests. It goes back and forth between Data. Data refuses Fajo's requests, and Fajo creates logical Traps, or morally complicated situations - that Data eventually sits on the chair. Fajo gets his way.

Eventually Data escapes. However, in the last showdown between Data and Fajo - Fajo taunts him, that he will continue harming other people - and Data cannot do anything against that. Data replies and answers, "I cannot permit this to continue." A moment later, he raises his hand to fire, but is beamed to the enterprise. O'Brian sees that the phaser has discharged and disables it. Data simply states, "it must have malfunctioned".

You can now interpret this scene as you like. Data may have done something that was not intended by his programming and evolved At that moment. Enabling Data to be a judge and executioner of Fajo - and that he now can lie as well. Or of course that there was simply a malfunction.

Star Trek: Lower Decks revisits the Collectors, which is a fun episode as well.
