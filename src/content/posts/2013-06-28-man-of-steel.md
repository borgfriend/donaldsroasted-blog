Let's talk about the new Superman movie “Man of Steel” (2013). I will share my thoughts on the movie and compare it a little bit to the original Superman movie (1978).

## The Magnificent Trailer of Man of Steel

The trailer features a coming-of-age story about Superman. Torn by inner conflicts, he struggles with questions of identity. He cannot handle the burden of the world. In addition, we have glimpses of a new threat arriving in spaceships and superman rising to the challenge.

The movie is a reboot of a very popular franchise. So what would I expect? Well in essence a similar movie like “Batman Begins” a new origin story, slightly darker than the original, more drama conflict, and based in reality.

## What do I remember from the original Superman (1978)

It has been a while since I last saw the original Superman movie. But lets see what I remember and how my expections are set what I would like to see in a rebooted Superman movie.

The first Superman movie in 1978 featured Superman's only weakness, Kryptonite, and Clark Kent's work at the Daily Planet. He grew up in Kansas and had a love interest, Lois Lane. The main villain was Lex Luthor, and there was an awesome ice cave. Some memorable scenes include Superman flying into space and fixing the Chinese Wall with his Laser-Constructor Vision. 

It was a fun and goofy movie, nothing too serious happened. Clark Kent being the useless guy standing in the way and nobody cares about him, and nobody notices that always when Superman appears, mysteriously Clark Kent cannot be found anywhere. No matter the fact that his “disguise” is are simple glasses. No one got killed, so the bad guys were put in jail and they easily escaped for the next movie.

In the end you leave the movie with a sense of positivity, and that feeling that the world is a good place. Superman is a hero, and he will save the day.

## Man of Steel (2013)

The opening of Man of Steel parallels "Superman I" with a detailed introduction to Krypton. This segment provides an impressive array of sights including flora, fauna, and a cloning facility a la _The Matrix_. General Zod's uprising is highlighted leading to his banishment to the Phantom Zone. Kal-El is then launched to Earth, coinciding with Krypton's implosion

Superman's backstory was told interestingly from that point on. Clark's conversations with his father, in which he learns about his origin, were particularly memorable. Later, Lois Lane begins to investigate him after he performs laser eye surgery on her. A nod is given to the original Superman comics where, at first, he could only jump high and far, later developing the ability to fly.

The writers started off strong, but ultimately failed to deliver a compelling movie. In fact, the film becomes forgettable after the point at which General Zod threatens Earth to extradite Superman. After this, the plot becomes unclear and hazy.
Superman surrenders to the humans, he tells them that he trusts them and he does not wants to do them any harm. For unknown reasons Louis has to tag along to the alien spaceship. The introduction of a Kryptonian atmosphere as Superman's weakness is poorly explained. In essence they said, “radioactive kryptonite” - that is way to complicated for the viewers, lets have superman's weakness be strange air. This culminates in a lengthy and over-the-top fight scene that takes place in Smallville and causes extensive destruction. While this whole mess is going on, the humans say, "aliens on earth?", of course we will smash them with our mighty weapons. So they try to kill all of them including superman and even tough superman is trying to protect the human population, the humans fire missile after missile at superman. However, when Superman saves a minor commander, the humans suddenly change their tune and place their complete trust in him.

Zod, after watching the last failed reboot movie \*”Superman returns” \*uses kryptonian technology to start terraforming earth to transform it into krypton. Superman counters by watching the _Incredibles_ and figures out, flying exactly through the alien robot is enough to destroy it. While the humans watch _Star Trek 11_ and use red-matter from the small baby transport capsule to crash into the other alien vessel to create a black hole, sorry I meant a phantom zone portal. 
However General Zod’s were prepared they watched _Transformers III_ and _Battleship_. They know that the biggest fear of humans are slowly toppling skyscraper buildings. 

At this point I should mention all the different types destruction in this movie. It opens with a planet destruction and follows it up with a oil rig destruction, tornado, village destruction, city destruction.
As expected the humans win, and open a phantom zone portal that acts like a big vacuum cleaner - that based on movie logic only effects random rocks, cars, and obviously Kryptonians. But not Superman he is the hero, or Louis Lane, she is human. Every thing is fine, floating Kiss for Louis – the End.

What? Oh boy another endless smack down, General Zod apparently was not sucked into the phantom zone. He gets a special +2 modifier for watching “_X-Men 1_” and “_Spiderman 2_“, by first using his laservision  like cyclops to cut a skyscraper in two and the same skyscraper as before topples down a second time (this time from another angle #unbelievable #omg), then instead of flying steals the dr. octopus way of climbing up buildings to smack superman again. In the end Louis magically teleports from the edge of the destroyed city into the train station, Superman brutally murders Zod, Superman cries in the arms of Louis. Clark says hi to his mum, and starts working at the Daily Planet.

## Overall

It's a movie that starts out very strong and then loses the will to live. Too much stuff was crammed into the movie, most of which was unnecessary. I believe that if you cut out a lot of the fat and useless smackdowns, it could have been a very good movie. The visuals overall are stunning and emotionally powerful. However, the abusive use of entirely white frames or blown-out images should be forbidden.

I really missed Lex Luthor and Clark Kent in this movie. Clark Kent is a guy in a suit working for the Daily Planet. I do not associate some random unknown person rescuing people with Clark Kent. It would have been better to introduce him in this movie in some fashion. They should have simply used the same formula as Superman I: Lex Luthor and something to make land more valuable, and Superman II: General Zod drops by earth and wants to conquer it. It's a reboot, so you have to include the old stuff as well as some new stuff. Or better yet, make something new, but that's a totally different story.
