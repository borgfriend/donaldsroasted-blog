If you think there's not much you can do with just three simple shapes, think again. Thomas Was Alone imbues each rectangle with superpowers and puts them in beautifully designed minimalist environments. The game challenges them with difficult puzzles and provides an interesting story that will keep you engaged.

As you play this jump-and-run puzzler, you'll be treated to a beautiful soundtrack and a perfect narrator who pulls you in and makes you feel compassion for these simple shapes that are jumping around on your screen.

Even though you are playing with simple rectangles it is a well-rounded game.
