The next Star Trek movie is being presented by the Fast and the Furious crew, and from the looks of the trailer, it seems like the franchise is returning to its glory days of "The Next Generation." The captain is going to be facing a difficult issue that takes a profound look at humanity and how far we've come.

The issue this time around is that there are too many fast and loud sci-fi action movies, and this one seems to be even louder and faster than ever before. Oh well... hopefully they are not ripping of some other Star Trek movie again...
