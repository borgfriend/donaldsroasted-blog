Vestige is a dark and disturbing game with an extremely beautiful and expressive game environment. The atmosphere and story are handled brilliantly, as you are trapped in a former subway station and have to escape alive.

The game requires you to use a decoy device to solve various puzzles, but instead of using it as a decoy, you have to find creative alternative ways to solve the puzzles.

Despite being produced in just 20 weeks with only nine team members, the game is very well-made. Although the game length is short, I'm looking forward to seeing what else these talented people will create in the future.

You can download the game from their website:
