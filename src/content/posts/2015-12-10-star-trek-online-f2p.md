If you're a Star Trek fan looking for an MMORPG that lets you explore the entire Star Trek universe, you might enjoy this game. It's also designed for people who aren't familiar with the franchise and provides extensive backstories and information about the various alien races, as well as the history of the universe.

# Game

The game is divided into space and ground sections, but while the space sections are exciting, the ground sections can be a bit dull. As you level up, you earn new and larger ships every ten levels. Quests are divided into daily and episode quests, with completing the latter allowing you to level up quickly. However, the middle of the episodes can become repetitive and tedious. But as you progress and reach the Undine Quests, the game becomes more diverse and the quests are better. The current featured episode, "The 2800," is especially well made and even resolves a plot hole left by Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.

Sadly, the "exploration" aspect of the game can be lackluster, such as beaming down to uninhabited planets to find only a few debris from some crashed probe. Most of the game can be played in single-player mode, but some parts, such as fleet actions, are designed for a minimum of five players. You can also easily join an auto team to play with others.


After completing the episodes, there isn't much to do except wait for new ones, although you can collect several item sets, such as the Breen Set, Borg Set, Omega Force, and MACO. The game is free to play, but you can buy many items, including a new ship, once you reach level 50.

Overall, I had a great time playing this game. I appreciated the small details of the lush environments and strange new worlds, and it's definitely worth checking out for any Star Trek fan.
