Nobody expected great things from "The Lego Batman". And what did we get? Probably the best version of the caped crusader since the "Dark Knight".

It's hard to prepare for the awesomeness of Lego Batman. The movie includes all of Batman's villains, the Justice League, and so much more.

If you're a fan of Batman, this movie is a must-see. And if you want to let your inner child squeal with delight, "The Lego Batman" is the perfect movie for you.
