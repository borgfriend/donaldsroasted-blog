I finally got the chance to revisit Jedi Knight II. Does it hold up after all these years, or is it only great because of nostalgia?

I had forgotten how frustrating the first couple of levels can be. The Imperial Blaster works just like it does in the Star Wars films - only every third shot actually hits the target you are aiming at. The levels are designed as mazes, and you need to solve small puzzles.

After the first couple of levels, the story kicks into gear. Your partner is killed by a Dark Jedi, and you want revenge. After a quick force training level, you get your light-saber back.

Then finally, the first level where you get your light-saber and can slice up some thugs in a bar? No, you learn the hard lesson that you cannot block sniper shots, and even if you only see two pixels of an enemy's head, a disintegration shot kills you immediately. Well, "Quick-Save" and "Quick-Load" are your friends, I suppose...

After surviving that stupid level, the game actually becomes quite enjoyable. You get to visit Cloud City, and over time, the game gets better as you start learning new force skills, making light-saber battles much easier. They even try to recreate iconic scenes from The Empire Strikes Back.

Overall, the game has its issues. While I really like FPS games that are more maze-like and promote exploration, this game puts in a lot of effort to tell the story of Kyle Katarn and only uses minor iconic elements from the movies, making it a really nice extension of the Star Wars universe.

The nostalgia effect is definitely there. It was one of the first games that made light-saber battles look good and possible (previously, normal weapons were the better choice, and you only used the light-saber as a last option).

Next Up: Jedi Academy...
