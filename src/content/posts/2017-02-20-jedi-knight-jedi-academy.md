After revisiting Jedi Knight II, I was excited to try out its sequel, Jedi Academy. Kyle Kartan retains his force powers and takes on the role of a teacher, passing on his knowledge to new students by giving them lightsabers and sending them out to battle. However, in terms of education, the game falls a bit short.

The game is essentially a mission pack for Jedi Knight II, with only slight improvements to the combat system and the addition of dual and double-sided lightsabers. While it doesn't matter which force powers you use, how you use them can determine whether you fall to the dark or light side. In reality, the only thing that pushes you towards the dark side is killing off an annoying NPC who was already seduced by the dark side. (Well if you don't kill him he is saved blabla). 

But you probably should kill him, simply because it makes the last couple of levels more interesting, as you have the double amount of lightsaber wielding enemy's - everybody hates you, that's justification enough to slaughter them all and become the most powerful dark lord of all time.

Despite its shortcomings, there is one redeeming factor: the multiplayer mode. However, with the decline of LAN parties, this is no longer as enjoyable as it once was. Ultimately, the game is lacking and the only thing that makes it worth revisiting is nostalgia.
