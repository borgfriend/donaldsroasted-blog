I must admit that I encountered some difficulties while reading this book. Although it comprises many interesting stories about Jordan Peterson's life, it reads like a mini-autobiography with the lessons he learned and teaches from his experiences. This style of writing is not what I typically enjoy.

Now here and then there are fascinating stories of interpretations of bible texts and core moments you find in movies.

> Rule 1 - Jordan Peterson

This is the core message of the book. Take responsibility of your life. Walk through life, because life has a meaning. - and be a good person on the way. Be as truthful as possible. Speech and words have immense meaning. - and always keep learning from other people.

So toughen up, be responsible and do something with your life.
