D.C. is desperately trying to make a good superhero movie. They managed to create a very compelling Trailer for Shazam! A kid that is a superhero...

You can almost see the manager at Warnerbros pitching the movie. It is just like Deadpool, but for kids. Its funny like Marvel movies. Exactly what the moviegoers want to see.

I really hope that this movie is good. I do not have high hopes, but it would be great to see that D.C. finally to create a great movie again without too much buisness compromises.
