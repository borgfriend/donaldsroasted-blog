A really cool course has just started on edX, called [Star Trek: Inspiring Culture and Technology](https://www.edx.org/course/star-trek-inspiring-culture-and-technology) created by the Smithsonian Institute. As part of the course, participants are encouraged to create their own "Starlog."

I began watching Star Trek: The Next Generation when I was just 7 years old. My favorite character was the Chief Engineer, Jordi LaForge. He was an engineer who could make repairs, understand how things worked, and his best friend was a robot. To me, he seemed like the coolest guy ever.

In addition to working on the Enterprise as an engineer, Jordi also showed us how amazing our world is, how it works, and read books to us on the show Reading Rainbow. I thought he must have been the smartest guy on the planet.

At the time, LeVar Burton was my ultimate role model. I could not wait to see the next episode of Star Trek, and then run to the library to check out as many books as possible to learn more.

Today, I work as a Software Engineer and I have to thank Star Trek for getting me interested in engineering and computers. I still watch a lot of DS9, TNG, and occasionally VOY today. These shows have so much material that can make you think deeply.

I am looking forward to taking this course. In the past, I have taken many brilliant courses about Software Engineering on the edX platform, and I am confident that this course will not disappoint me.
