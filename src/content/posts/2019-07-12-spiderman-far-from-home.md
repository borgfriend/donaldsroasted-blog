Spiderman: Far From Home had one job: to answer the question of whether there is an MCU after the bittersweet end of Avengers: Endgame. And it delivers a resounding "yes" while providing a great Spiderman story.

The Elementals are perhaps some of the most intriguing villains of the MCU. While their nature and motivation to take over Earth may seem like a rehash of previous villains, they are given multiple layers that make them much more interesting than what we've seen for a long time in the MCU.

Overall, the movie effectively serves as an epilogue to Avengers: Endgame and launches the next phase of the MCU. If you're a fan of the franchise, it's definitely worth checking out.
