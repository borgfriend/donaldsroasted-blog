I really enjoy the games produced by 11bit studios, and Moonlighter is no exception. It's a fun rogue-like game where you take on the role of a shopkeeper during the day and explore dungeons at night to collect loot.

The game features beautiful pixel art and each dungeon is randomly generated, with a challenging end boss to defeat. However, the desert boss is particularly difficult, even more so than the final boss of the game.

While the game mechanics are generally good, there are a few flaws. For example, you can enchant your weapon multiple times, but not on the first try. There are also more types of potions available than just health potions, which I only discovered towards the end of the game. Additionally, broken weapons can be found, but they cannot be repaired.

The story has a nice build-up, hinting at something greater going on, but the payoff is somewhat strange. The game includes the typical old man character found in many dungeon crawlers, who warns you about the dangers and inevitability of death.

Overall, it was great to get the game for free on the Epic Game store, and I had a lot of fun playing this little gem.
