## **tl;dr:**

Take responsibility and control of your life. With hard work and a clear vision, you can achieve anything. You have the tools and the permission to live life on your own terms. It's okay to take risks and step outside your comfort zone. Don't wake up early for a life you don't want to live.

## **Recommendation**

This book covers a wide range of topics on how to take care of your body and mind. It's a great summary of various aspects of your life that you can improve and take control of instead of relying on your internal autopilot. While it's a great starting point, there are better books available that delve deeper into the various subjects.

## **Key Points to Remember**

### **Self Talk**

People tend to have negative self-talk. Try to change it into a positive one. Record your thoughts and play them back to yourself to realize how silly they sound. Ask yourself if your self-talk represents your own thoughts or if it's imposed by other people's standards. Have your own standards and commit to your own values.

Commit yourself to your own mantra and values.

### **State of Mind**

There are four states of mind: optimistic, negative, in-between (meh), and resourceful (you can do anything). You can actively manage your state of mind by remembering when you were in a different state and recreating that feeling. Find an outlet to release negative energy. The more you actively take control, the easier it gets in the future.

### **Gorilla Focus**

#### **Regain your focus**

Focus on positive things and don't let negative things frustrate you. Focus on your goals; other things are just distractions. Don't be a slave to others.

#### **Develop Gorilla Focus**

1. What do I want more of?
2. What do you want less of?
3. Does \[person/activity\] bring you more of what you want?
4. Does \[person/activity\] bring you less of what you want?

Good health is essential for focus. Focus on what matters most in life. Focus on one thing at a time. Pick one task to accomplish at a time and complete it.

### **Lifestyle**

Your lifestyle and mindset are linked. Cut off contact with negative people and learn to say no to everything. Sleep as much as you can because there's nothing cool about sleep deprivation.

### **Health and Fitness**

- Avoid sitting for more than an hour
- Stay hydrated
- Go outside every day
- Do something physical every day

### **Establish a morning routine**

The momentum of your life starts with your morning routine.

Never hit the snooze button. Everyone is tired in the morning, but getting up right away sets the tone for the day. Rush to the shower and take a cold shower, which is a powerful way to start the day.

### **You are an authority**

No external force can dictate how you live your life. You are the authority who sets the standards.

### **Have a vision of your life**

Visualizing where you want to be is a powerful tool that helps you achieve your goals.

## **Conclusion**

The book is designed as a workbook to help you turn your life around and take responsibility for it. If it did one thing well, it was to inspire you to define and live by your own standards every day, and motivate you to try to improve yourself every day, even if it's just a little bit.
