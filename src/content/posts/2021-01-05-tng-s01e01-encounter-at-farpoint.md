The first episode of TNG is a little strange - it's clear the writers hadn't quite figured out what they wanted to do yet.

One standout aspect of the episode is how the new Enterprise is introduced as a technical marvel, a very powerful ship that can match or exceed Warp speeds. It's immediately pitted against Q, one of the most powerful beings in the universe, who is smartly portrayed as being first superior technologically, and later by killing and reviving a crew member.

The writers created a situation in which the Enterprise must surrender; the conflict cannot be solved through power and violence, only negotiation and cooperation. Q puts humanity on trial and allows the crew to demonstrate that they've moved beyond their savage ways. They are temporarily allowed to continue their mission and travel to Farpoint Station.

While the actual mission at Farpoint is a little weak, the second part of the episode introduces us to more character dynamics between the captain and crew, as well as Riker and the crew. However, many of these dynamics and story elements are ultimately forgotten as the show progresses.

One of the most powerful concepts introduced in the episode is the holodeck, which becomes a recurring element in many episodes.

Overall, it's a beautiful start to a new series that hints at how things have changed and evolved, and introduces us to interesting characters. Needless to say, the crew passes the test and Q leaves, promising to return.
