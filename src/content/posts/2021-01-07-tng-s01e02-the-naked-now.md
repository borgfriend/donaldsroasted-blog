The purpose of TNG was to establish itself as a continuation of Kirk's adventures. To achieve this, the show aired a callback episode where everyone on the Enterprise is infected by a molecule that makes them act drunk and horny.

During the episode, Wesley is given more depth, demonstrating his impressive engineering skills by building a personal tractor beam and a voice simulator device. However, for the first half of the episode, nothing else stands out as everyone is merely acting "drunk."

The real fun of the episode begins when everybody starts acting drunk and horny. It leaves you wondering what the writers were thinking. The episode also plays on the nostalgia of the Original Series, with the Enterprise suddenly facing immediate danger of destruction. The over-the-top dramatic music accompanies the visuals, including the soon-to-explode star. Additionally, a lot of sound effects from the original series are used.

The episode goes beyond what anyone has seen before when Data, an android, becomes intimate with Tasha Yar. We learn that Data is fully functional and programmed to provide pleasure. Furthermore, the Captain is seduced by Beverly Crusher with the line, "I am a woman without a husband and needs."

The ship is eventually saved by a magic hypospray administered by Wesley and drunk Data. Overall, it's an incredibly silly episode.
