TNG had a challenging beginning, and unfortunately, this episode is one of its worst.

The show faced several difficulties in its production, from the writing to the acting and set dressing, all of which seem to work against it.

Interestingly, this episode has been voted as the second-worst episode of all of Star Trek.
