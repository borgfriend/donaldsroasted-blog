This episode is worth watching at least once, mainly due to its historical significance as the first appearance of the Ferengi.

The Enterprise is led on a chase to a mysterious planet, where the ship faces an existential threat of extreme power loss. The Doctor considers putting Wesley to sleep for good, which raises suspicion as we do not see him in this episode.

The Ferengi, a race of capitalist traders, are introduced in this episode. While they go on to be awesome in Deep Space Nine, in TNG Season 1 they speak and act stupidly, making it challenging to take them seriously. They are the big bad guys, but their over-the-top antics make them funny and weird rather than threatening.

Oddly enough, "Quark" from Deep Space Nine appears in this episode, but the actor Armin Shimerman plays a different Ferengi, "Letek," whom we will never hear from again.

The mysterious planet is revealed to be a guardian of an ancient lost civilization that was sucking up all the energy. Riker's interaction with the guardian is a highlight of the episode, demonstrating his intelligence, charisma, leadership, and wisdom. Riker showcases that the Federation is not barbaric, allowing both ships to leave freely.
