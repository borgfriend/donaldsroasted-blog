This episode raises some interesting questions but fails to provide any real answers.

The premise is that there is a planet without any crime, where everyone engages in sexual activity with each other. However, the one rule on this planet is that every crime is punishable by death, enforced by "god," an alien craft in orbit.

In reality, such a rule would likely lead to a violent society, as people would become indifferent to murder and trespassing, as they are treated identically. However, in Star Trek, we believe in the goodness of people.

Wesley accidentally breaks a glass and is subject to punishment, prompting the question of whether the Enterprise should respect the laws of this alien culture.

Despite the potential for an interesting storyline, the episode falls flat, with a simple speech about compassion to the god aliens quickly resolving any conflict.
