Beware of Ferengis bearing gifts.

This episode brings a nostalgic feeling as we get to see The Stargazer in a classic TOS. We are introduced to a couple of interesting stories from Picard's past, including his time on the Stargazer and his battle with an unknown ship, which turns out to be of Ferengi origin.

One of the highlights of the episode is the introduction of the Picard maneuver, where a ship accelerates at Warp to fool the sensors that the ship is in two places at the same time. However, the plot takes a turn when Picard starts experiencing headaches that are eventually traced back to a Ferengi device that forces him to relive the past and attempt to destroy the Enterprise.

Unfortunately, the entire Ferengi plot feels contrived, with a father seeking revenge for his son's death by manipulating the captain's psychology with Ferengi thought spheres. It raises questions about why the Stargazer was abandoned when it's still a fully functioning ship, and there are easier ways to get revenge that are more consistent with the Ferengi way.

On a positive note, this episode showcases Data's evolution towards becoming more machine-like, with less emphasis on emotions and more focus on his outstanding calculation speed. He manages to come up with a counter to the Picard maneuver by tracking the compression of gas around the ship.

Overall, this episode is forgettable, with interesting concepts and stories from Picard's past, but a poorly executed plot with contrived elements.
