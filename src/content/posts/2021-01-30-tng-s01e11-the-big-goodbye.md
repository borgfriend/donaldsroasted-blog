This episode is truly monumental, as it marks the first full holodeck episode, complete with all of the core tropes:

* Safety Protocols being disabled and leading to a near-death experience
* A malfunction in the holodeck
* An obscure and random historical setting that we may never see again

Although the story itself may not be exceptional, the meeting room scene is quite entertaining. In it, Picard forgets about a meeting, accidentally asks Beverly out on a date, and promptly ruins the moment by inviting some additional friends.

Despite any shortcomings, the episode is significant as it provides an introduction to the Holodeck and showcases the intricate attention to detail given to the old-style costumes and setting.
