This episode is the first Data-centric one, and it's a perfect fit. It delves into the mystery of Data's origin and features thought-provoking discussions about androids. It also includes a fun action-packed fistfight, good dialogue, and showcases brilliant performances by both Data and his evil twin, Lore. The episode's attention to detail makes Data even more Datalike by exploring how he speaks and his range of facial expressions, which is starkly contrasted with Lore's limited facial expressions.

The episode introduces us to Lore, Data's evil brother, the Crystalline Entity, and showcases Worf's uselessness against an android. It also introduces Data's on/off switch.

One of the standout moments of the episode is the brilliant discussion on the use of pronouns. When Lore is perceived disassembled as a machine, Picard uses "it" as an object. However, Data is referred to as "he" because he is modeled after a male body. The beauty of this discussion is that there is no ill intent in the linguistic choice. Picard genuinely wants to use the right language that does not offend anyone. It highlights the fact that it is rare to encounter an android, and there is simply a lack of knowledge about the right terminology to use.

It's unfortunate that such a simple dialog would not be possible these days without inviting an angry mob of "gender politics" and "choose your own pronoun." However, it's essential to realize that there's not always ill intent from the other party.

The only downside of this episode is that there's still no improvement in how Wesley is written. However, it does give us the iconic "Shut up Wesley" scene, which has become a fan favorite. It's still unclear why Wesley is so widely hated, but perhaps it's because the writers did not know what to do with him, and the actor did not have much to work with. Maybe the other characters acted stupidly when he was around, and he saved the day due to the sudden drop in IQ around him.
