Today's episode takes place on a planet where women are the dominant gender, and men are objectified and viewed as stupid. Our crew is tasked with finding a couple of missing members who disappeared seven years ago. Star Trek bureaucracy at its finest. Like as if the paperwork got lost and only now they are getting around to the rescue mission.

There's also a virus on the ship that could wipe out the entire crew, but the story is so bland and uninteresting that it hardly seems worth mentioning.

One notable aspect of the episode is that Riker gets to lead the mission and is considered attractive enough that the planet's leader has a crush on him. He even wears the proper male outfit for the planet, which looks a bit silly but shows respect for their customs. (I'm not sure what the diplomacy book says about getting laid.)

In the end, we meet the missing survivors, but they don't want to be rescued because they've become symbols of a revolution for gender equality on the planet.

While the episode doesn't directly address gender equality, it does make an interesting argument that biological differences exist between genders, as evidenced by the fact that females are dominant on this planet. Riker's speech at the end is compelling but doesn't present a strong argument for gender equality. It simply suggests that it's an enlightened goal that will happen naturally in a more progressive society.

This episode had the potential to explore what a society dominated by one gender would look like, but instead, it takes the simplistic approach of simply making it "opposite day" and doesn't offer much meaningful commentary on the topic.
