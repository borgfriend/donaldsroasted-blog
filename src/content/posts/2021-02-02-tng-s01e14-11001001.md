Another incredible episode of TNG! This one delves into the Holodeck and the potential consequences of simulating a person based on subconscious desires. It raises questions about what happens when a species becomes overly reliant on computer technology, which is sure to fail eventually.

The episode also takes a deeper dive into Data's character, exploring whether he has the ability to create a painting. Plus, it plants the first seeds of the Geordi-Data friendship, as Riker remarks, "A blind person teaches an android to paint."

The plot is expertly crafted, starting with a simple computer upgrade and escalating to the theft of a starship and the kidnapping of the captain and Riker. This is one of those episodes where every character shines, leaving you craving more of these excellent stories.
