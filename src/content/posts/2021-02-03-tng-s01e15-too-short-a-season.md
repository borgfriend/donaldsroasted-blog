Once again, we find ourselves at the bottom of the barrel with this episode. It features a corrupt, insane Admiral who takes a youth potion in an attempt to rectify a mistake he made 45 years ago. The episode feels drawn out, with many filler scenes used to pad its length.

While this episode does showcase a minor flaw in the Federation's idealism, it fails to explore the possibility of deeper, more significant flaws within the organization.
