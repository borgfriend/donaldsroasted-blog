The quality of the episodes is improving, however, this particular one can be summarized as follows: “We refuse to sell children.” “Very well, we’ll take them.” “Here’s a cure for radiation poisoning.” “Okay, you can have them back.”

This episode takes a moral stance against "infertile people" who resort to any means necessary to have children. In reality, there is a simple solution to this problem - adoption. Simply repeating that your children are the most important thing and that you will never give them up is not very profound. It would have been great if the Federation could have established an adoption program or some other kind of solution with this planet.

What I enjoyed in this episode were the children who chose the path of passive resistance, refusing to eat to communicate to their new guardians that they want to go back home.

Furthermore, this episode serves as a warning against societies that are completely reliant on technology and have a lack of knowledge. The inhabitants of the planet have no understanding of how things work, and they cannot feed the machine with new information. Essentially, they have a gigantic search engine and have lost the ability to conduct proper scientific research.  A good thing that nothing like that exists in the real world.
