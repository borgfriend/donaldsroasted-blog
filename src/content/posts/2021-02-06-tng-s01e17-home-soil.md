The Next Generation is really coming into its own as the actors start to embody the beloved characters we know today.

At the heart of this episode are some fascinating science-fiction concepts. It delves into the possibility and challenges of terraforming a planet.

The episode begins with the murder of a crew member on a terraforming expedition. However, it quickly moves on to explore the difficulty of defining what constitutes a life-form. The crew of the Enterprise discovers a new life-form that tries to take over the ship.

One intriguing scene involves a discussion about whether the creature they found truly fits the definition of a life-form. During this conversation, the creature demonstrates the minimum requirements for being classified as such. Unfortunately, the entire murder subplot serves as filler around the more interesting life-form discussion. Nonetheless, the episode's story structure is better compared to previous ones.
