This episode examines how to deal with success and failure.

Picard is tested to see if he is a loyal officer. Although he passes and is offered a promotion to admiral, he decides to refuse it because he doesn't want to get involved in Federation politics. However, something sinister is going on.

A fellow student who also wanted to go to the Starfleet Assessment Center fails to get a spot. He puts so much pressure on himself that he can't even tell his father about it. Feeling like a failure, he tries to run away and almost gets himself killed in the shuttle he steals.

At the assessment center, Wesley meets Modoc, a blue alien. Modoc almost fails a test when he can't identify an alien species, but Wesley helps him later on when he struggles with a task. In the end, Wesley fails to get accepted by Starfleet Academy, coming in second to Modoc, who is the first of his kind in Starfleet.

I think both candidates had equal test scores, but the fact that Modoc is the first of his species joining tipped the balance in his favor. I don't like this in the episode because Wesley should not need to retake the test; he was qualified to join. They should have put him on a waiting list if they didn't have the capacity at the moment. He should not have felt like he failed.

"Just remember, running away from something does not solve the problem," says Picard. In the end, Wesley fails to get a spot at Starfleet Academy and feels like he has let down everyone on the Enterprise. But Picard gives him great life advice:

> "The only person you are truly competing against is yourself...(you) have to measure your successes and failures from within, not by anything that I or anyone might think," says Picard.

I always thought this was an episode from one of the later seasons. It definitely has a few major logical flaws, but the message of the episode is important. It's one of my favorites.
