The Enterprise crew encounters their first advertisement when they come across a planet selling weapons under the guise of ensuring freedom. However, it sounds too good to be true. The planet uses superior sales tactics and sends a sample of their product: semi-intelligent, learning, and self-upgrading drones that attack the away team and the Enterprise, putting them at risk of defeat. The situation is eventually resolved when Picard agrees to buy the weapons system, and everything is settled. It seems the sales quota has been met.

It's refreshing to see Geordi take command and Riker has a great conversation with a holographic computer. It's always amusing to know that “Riker is a commander on the Lollipop”.

This episode is full of impressive special effects and action sequences. However, it serves as a warning about creating something like Skynet, which could lead to the destruction of a planet.
