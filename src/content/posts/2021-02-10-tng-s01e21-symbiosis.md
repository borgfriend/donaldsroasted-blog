n this episode, the Enterprise is on a mission to rescue a freighter about to crash. However, the crew of the freighter beams over their cargo and themselves before the Enterprise can save them. The question arises, what could be more important than their own lives?

As it turns out, the episode focuses on the theme of drug addiction and explores the situation of two planets, where one planet provides drugs and the other provides all other goods. The medicine was necessary for survival, but its side-effect was addiction to the drug.

Wesley, a young member of the Enterprise crew, doesn't understand drugs, so Tasha gives him a heartfelt explanation. She doesn't blame drug users but instead explains the social circumstances that could lead someone to use drugs.

The Enterprise is bound by the Prime Directive and cannot interfere, but it also doesn't need to help. The drug-using planet will have to go through withdrawal. It is unclear if this will break the addiction, but there is hope that things will improve.

This episode makes a wonderful choice not to preach that drugs are bad but instead highlights how unhealthy social structures can form and be enforced through society. There is no simple solution to fix it, and the structures must break over time. Addiction is not something that can be fixed quickly.
