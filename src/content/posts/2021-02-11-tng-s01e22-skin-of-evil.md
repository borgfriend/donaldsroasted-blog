In this episode, Tasha dies, which is a tragic event considering we didn't really get to know her character. She is killed by a mysterious tar monster without any apparent reason, but at least she receives a respectful funeral.

The episode itself is focused on the evil tar monster, which, as Data points out, lacks any redeeming qualities. The Enterprise crew responds by placing a warning beacon and destroying the shuttle that the monster is trapped on, ensuring that it cannot leave the planet. Overall, it's not the most exciting episode and feels a bit lackluster compared to others in the series.
