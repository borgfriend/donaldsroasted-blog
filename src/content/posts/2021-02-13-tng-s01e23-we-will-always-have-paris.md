It seems that this episode may be more focused on romance. We get to witness Picard meeting with his former fianc√©e, whom he left to join Starfleet. Additionally, there is a plot involving a "dimensional time" issue that is resolved with the help of Data.

Overall, I would not recommend this episode, as it lacks significant relevance to the overarching plot. The only notable detail is that Picard briefly mentions his artificial heart, which becomes more relevant in Season 6.
