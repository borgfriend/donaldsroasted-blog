In this episode, the first season takes a dark turn into sci-fi horror. Aliens have infiltrated the federation, with a classic brain parasite that takes over the bodies of Admirals and Commanders. As the parasites feed on their hosts, they become stronger, with dire consequences for the crew of the Enterprise.

When watching the episode in 2021, the aliens might remind you of the Gual'uld of Stargate. There are some entertaining scenes, such as an old admiral beating up Riker's stunt double, then taking down Jordie's stunt double with a spectacular flying move. Worf also takes a swing at the admiral and lands behind the sofa, before Beverly comes to the rescue and phasers the admiral.

The special effects in this episode are impressive, with stop motion animation and exploding body doubles. While they are impressive for TV in the 80s, the episode overall is not the best. It is more in the territory of being "so bad it's good," with an odd and campy tone.
