The Enterprise stumbles upon some space debris, which initially doesn't seem significant. However, upon closer inspection, they discover three people who were cryogenically frozen.

In the meantime, the Enterprise is on its way to the neutral zone and encounters the Romulans for the first time. The Romulans will become a major antagonist, replacing the mysterious but somewhat silly Ferengi.

The people from the past who were frozen try to adapt to life on the Enterprise and understand how everything works. It's interesting to see how people from the 80s could adjust to living in the 24th century.

The episode also explores how Picard avoids a war with the Romulans and prefers diplomacy to violence. They soon discover that both parties have been attacked by an unknown force.

When one of the thawed-out individuals realizes that money is no longer a driving force in society, he questions what the challenge in life is. Picard eloquently responds:

> The challenge is to improve yourself, enrich yourself, enjoy
>
> Picard

The episode ends on a high note with a statement from Picard, indicating that there is still much to do and learn:

Riker: "Having them on board is like a visit from the past."

> That would take us in the wrong direction. Our mission is to go forward and it has just begun. (...) Still much to do, still so much to learn.
>
> Picard

The episode's closing moments provide a hopeful outlook for the future, leaving the audience excited for what's to come.
