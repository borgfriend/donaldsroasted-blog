The first season of The Next Generation is a bit odd, as the show was still finding its footing. However, despite this, there are a few episodes that are true masterpieces and shouldn't be missed.

If you're looking to experience the best of the first season, I highly recommend these episodes:

1. Episode 01: Encounter at Farpoint
2. Episode 05: Where No One Has Gone Before
3. Episode 12: Datalore
4. Episode 14: 11001001
5. Episode 18: Coming of Age
6. Episode 25: The Neutral Zone
  
These episodes offer great examples of what the show is capable of, and showcase some of the most interesting and memorable moments of the season.
