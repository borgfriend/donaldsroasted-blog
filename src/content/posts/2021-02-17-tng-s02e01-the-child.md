Season 2 of Star Trek: The Next Generation marks many changes in the show's storyline and character arcs. For example, Riker sports a new beard that gives him a more mature look, Crusher is replaced by a new doctor, Dr. Pulaski, and Jordi is promoted to chief engineer. Additionally, a new bartender is introduced, and these changes set up a new dynamic for the show. However, despite these changes, the first episode of the season is not particularly engaging and can be skipped without missing much.

The content of this episode is quite distressing, as it portrays an alien impregnating Troy, with her giving birth, watching her child grow up, and ultimately experiencing their death. The potential long-term psychological impact on Troy is not addressed in the episode, despite the trauma she would likely suffer. The fact that the alien claims to have had no harmful intentions and simply wanted to greet the Enterprise crew does not excuse their violation of Troy's bodily autonomy and emotional well-being. The episode raises serious ethical concerns that are not adequately addressed or resolved, leaving the viewer with a sense of discomfort and unease.

This episode should probably never have been written, or at the very least, someone should have considered the long-term implications that such an event would have on a person.
