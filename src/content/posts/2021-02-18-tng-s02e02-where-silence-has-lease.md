In this episode, the Enterprise encounters an alien entity that treats the ship like a toy in an experiment. While the idea of the ship being self-destructed in the second episode may seem unbelievable, the overall plot of the episode is somewhat unremarkable and lacks depth in exploring the theme of death. Picard's outsmarting of the alien is a minor but enjoyable highlight.
