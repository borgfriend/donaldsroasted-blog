In this episode, we once again delve into the wonders of the holodeck! Data struggles to grasp the game's rules, but manages to solve the mystery in just a few seconds. To add a challenge, Geordi instructs the computer to create an opponent capable of defeating Data.

Unfortunately, the computer takes this request too literally, and creates a self-aware Moriarty - essentially creating life within the holodeck.

This episode establishes the holodeck tropes:

1. Moriarty disables the safety protocols.
2. Moriarty not only takes control of the holodeck, but also the entire ship.
3. And as usual, we never see this particular holodeck setting again.
   
Despite these tropes, the episode is still brilliant, particularly in how it explores the difficulties of programming. Even the slightest misunderstanding can lead to massive consequences, as the crew discovers in their quest to shut down Moriarty's unexpected consciousness.
