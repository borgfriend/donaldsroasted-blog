This episode is a beautiful representation of the unique strengths and abilities that individuals with disabilities can bring to society. The character of Reva, who is deaf, communicates telepathically with a choir of three individuals. During a peace negotiation, the choir is killed, and Reva must accept and learn to embrace his disability.
