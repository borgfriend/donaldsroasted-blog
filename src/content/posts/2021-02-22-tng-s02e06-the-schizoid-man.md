Ah, the dream of immortality - a scientist puts his mind into the body of Data, but ultimately learns that immortality is not meant for him.

While the concept of the episode is intriguing, the execution falls a bit short. The scientist could have easily created a similar android and uploaded his brain to that body, with Data only serving as a temporary vessel. This idea has the potential to be explored much deeper, as seen in works like the film "Chappie" or the Amazon comedy series "Upload".

Despite its flaws, the episode may have been revolutionary for its time and has certainly inspired many spinoffs exploring the concept of immortality. After all, the desire for immortality has always been a wish of mankind.
