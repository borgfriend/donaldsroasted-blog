This episode provides an insightful exploration of Dr. Polaski's character, showcasing her ambitions and her drive to help others. Her similarities to Picard create occasional tension, but by the end of the episode, they develop a deeper understanding and respect for each other.

The episode's central premise involves genetic experimentation resulting in the creation of "super humans" with an overactive immune system that produces a virus lethal to ordinary humans.

It's really weird to see that the genetic alteration thing is just the backdrop of the episode. Other Star Trek stories such as Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan or DS9's Julian Bashir backstory delve more deeply into the subject.

The episode concludes on a surprising note, as the Enterprise crew accidentally discovers that the transporter can reverse aging effects and potentially confer immortality. This discovery is linked to DNA found in Dr. Polaski's quarters.
