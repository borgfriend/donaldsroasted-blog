The 10x Rule is a principle that anyone can learn and use to transform their lives. You don't need any special education, talents, or good fortune. By applying this rule, you can achieve success regardless of your circumstances. Your life will become easier, and you'll dream at higher levels than you ever thought possible.

I understand why some might think this sounds like a bad get-rich-quick scheme, but let's take a closer look at the book to see if there's anything useful in it.

## What is the 10x Rule?

People often underestimate the amount of time and effort required to achieve success. If you only put in an average amount of effort, you'll likely receive less than average results. To achieve success, you need to adjust your thinking so that you dare to dream at levels that you previously thought were impossible.

"Only you can know your true potential and whether or not you're living up to it." Success is like air: your last breath is not as important as your next one.

Highly successful people continue to be successful and produce more, even if it appears that they no longer need to. They continue to push themselves because that effort is necessary to accomplish new achievements.

The disappointment of the present moment is not because something is wrong, but because something is right - you desire change.

Never limit your desire for success. If you set targets that are too easy to reach, you'll fail because the target doesn't matter and you'll put in even less effort. The following are the four basic reasons for failing to achieve a goal:

1. **Mistargeting** - setting the objective too low, not the correct amount of motivation
2. **Underestimating Effort** - it requires a lot of energy and resources to achieve your goal
3. **Competing in your sector** - rather than competing, dominate your sector
4. **Underestimating the amount of adversity needed to overcome** - to actually attain their goal

Many of us are programmed to set targets that we didn't even design ourselves, based on our notions of what is possible, fair, morally good, bad, ugly, or what looks good, etc.  

Evert goal is difficult to achieve, and there are going to be disappointments along the way.  

Setting goals that are too low and hitting them is a mistake. You'll be surprised that you still didn't get what you wanted. If you try to achieve "unrealistic" goals, even if you fall short, you'll still have accomplished something.

To be successful, you need to keep succeeding. Losing 10 pounds and gaining 12 is not considered success.
**The 10x rule is about what you have to think and do to get to a point 10x more gratifying than you have ever imagined.**

## Why the 10x Rule is Vital

Almost every project is underestimated, and unexpected things happen. The biggest mistake you can make is to reduce a target. Instead, increase your actions. Any target is achievable with persistence and the right amount of action.

We tend to make excuses instead of taking responsibility and acting. We want to blame failure on everything else except for our level of activity (i.e., the amount of action we take).

To pitch your idea to one person, try inviting 10 people. If you're lucky, you'll get one person. Don't be pessimistic; be prepared. Approach everything with the ferocity of a champion athlete getting their last chance to be in the history books. Make no excuses and adopt an "in it to win it, whatever it takes" attitude.

Success doesn't just happen; it's a series of actions taken over time. Luck is a part of it, but the more actions you take the better the chances are of getting "lucky".

## What is Success?

Success is defined by your life condition, and it can be found anywhere.

1. Success is important
2. It is your moral duty to be successful
3. There is no shortage of success (If you are successful you do not take that away from another)

Success is critical. **If you quit caring, then you quit winning.** Nobody benefits from your failure.

## Success is your duty

When you realize that success is your ethical responsibility, you shift your mindset and begin to work towards it. You stop deceiving yourself and take the necessary steps to ensure your success.

## Assume Control of Everything

Success is not something that happens to you - you create success, it is because of the actions that you take.  
Do not blame as a reason why something happened or did not happen. Whether you were in control or not take responsibility of the situation.  
If there is a power outage, yes that was not under your control. You could have prepared with a backup generator. Blaming does not help in the situation. It is your responsibility to find a solution to get out of the situation.

## Four degrees of action

Disciplined constant action is much better than a singular action. The more actions you take the more likely you are to hit it big.  

There are four choices for action:

1. Do nothing.
2. Retreat.
3. Take normal levels of action
4. Take massive action

## Doing Nothing

People who do nothing have given up on their dreams. Signs that you are doing nothing include boredom, lethargy, and a lack of purpose. Doing nothing takes effort and results in unfulfillment.

Doing nothing actually takes a lot of energy. It takes work to be overlooked for a promotion, it takes work to explain yourself, it takes creativity and energy. It confuses friends and family when you say you are happy - but it is obvious that you are not living up to your potential.

### Retreaters

People who retreat take a lot of energy to explain why they retreat. They face a little bit of hardship and then they take the opposite action and give up on improving.

### Normal Levels of action

Take enough actions that are necessary. this is a dangerous path as this leads to the 'middle class' you have just enough. They end up being average, and by definition, the average is less than ordinary.  
Minor life events can throw you off balance because you were doing enough and now are under stress due to the unexpected additional burden.  
Nobody desires average. The average is the most dangerous level. As average is accepted by society. This is not enough to catapult you to success.

### Massive Action

This is the natural state of action for all of us. Children are always in action. It is only that other adults start telling you to take less action.  
When you take massive action, you are not thinking about how many hours you work. It is treating success as a duty. It is the only thing that matters.  
People may call you a workaholic, obsessive, greedy - whatever this comes only from people that are only taking normal levels of action - the social norm. People will criticize you to justify that there is nothing wrong with them.  
It will not come from people that are also successful they know that this is the level you have to operate on.  
Even managers may try to discourage you. You know you are stepping into the realm of massive action when 1. you are starting to create new problems for yourself. and 2 get criticism from others.  
No one is going to come to your house and make your dreams come true. You must take massive action. It is important to dominate your domain. Taking massive action will break you through obscurity, increase your value in the marketplace and help you generate success in any area you elect.

## 10X Goals

If goals are important you should write them down every day. And choose objectives out of reach.  
To get through the resistance you need a big goal to get there. - The more unrealistic they are but they are aligned to your purpose and duty you will get there and you will be energized to get there.  
Setting realistic goals will give you a realistic life. This is based on what others have built for themselves.  
Notice another thing about setting goals. You are setting them for yourself, not for anyone else. Anything is possible, You have more potential than you realize, no matter what the goal it will require work.

## Dominate your sector

Forward thinkers do not copy; instead, they dominate their markets, just like Apple. Never play by established rules.

## Obsession

Obsession is a good thing, everyone that is successful is obsessed with something. It only has a negative connotation.

### Time Management

You have to take a look at all the small things in your day that may be wasteful. Prioritize exactly what you want to accomplish.

## Criticism is a Sign of Success

When people start criticizing, then this is a signal of success. You are being recognized. People will always try to bring you down. But for that, you have to be someone first.  
Real feedback, like complaints about your product - is a gift. You can use that to improve your product.

## Omnipresence

Your goal must be to be like Coca-Cola, Apple, etc. Everybody should know who you are. Everybody should know how good you are. As soon as everyone knows your name your business will explode. Write blog posts, Twitter, Facebook, etc. use social media to be known.

## Conclusion

The book inspires you to take action and control your life. It is a nice inspirational read, in the middle it's slightly a drag, but it ends on a high note that the author expects that you will now take action. - But in the end, it is the responsibility of the reader to do something.
