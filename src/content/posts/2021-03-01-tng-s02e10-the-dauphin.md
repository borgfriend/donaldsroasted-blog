Ah, to be young and fall in love with an alien... This episode focuses on Wesley as he falls in love with a shapeshifting alien.

It is interesting how the writers portrayed different styles of flirting, from the raw Klingon roar to the over-the-top Riker maneuver of calling someone "the most beautiful woman in the galaxy." Wesley manages to win the heart of the alien, but their love is short-lived as she must save her home planet, ultimately leading to their separation. Guinan is there to comfort Wesley in the end, providing a fitting conclusion to the episode.
