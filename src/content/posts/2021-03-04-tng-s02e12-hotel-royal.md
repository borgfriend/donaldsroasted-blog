This is a wonderful and abstract episode that imagines what could happen when we first encounter aliens. The aliens don't understand humans and mistake our fantasy worlds from books as the reality we live in. A similar concept is revisited in "DS9 - If Wishes Were Horses."

Overall, it's a slightly different Holodeck episode, but it has some nice scenes, like when Riker hands Data a book and asks for a summary. Data flips through it in one second and then tells the plot.

The episode also introduces younger viewers to gambling, which perhaps nobody had thought about. Interestingly, it switches from Blackjack to Craps, probably to avoid portraying card counting as too realistic for Data.

In any case, the Enterprise crew ends up buying the casino and becoming the proud owners of the "Hotel Royale." They neglect to put up a warning sign to deter others from visiting and getting trapped there, leaving the next poor soul to be stuck.
