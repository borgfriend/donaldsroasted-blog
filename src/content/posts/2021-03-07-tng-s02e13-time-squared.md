In this episode, Riker cooks a meal but only Worf likes it. Honestly, I'm not quite sure what's going on in this episode. The crew discovers a shuttle from the future with a future version of Picard on board. He is angry with his future self for abandoning the Enterprise and causing its destruction. They need to close the time loop, and in the end, it seems that one of the Picards kills the other to solve the problem.

It reminds me of the mess of the movie Looper. - If Picard kills himself then he does not find him in the shuttle, then the entire plot does not play out this way.

The episode seems to suggest that the future is already predetermined, except when it's not. I enjoyed the omelette scene in the beginning, though. It was fun to see all the characters eating together.
