I'm not sure about this one... For Riker, it would have been better if this episode had never existed. He's offered his own command, but he never gives a real reason why he didn't accept it. From now on, we're left wondering why he's still on the Enterprise. Riker's personality and ambitions would demand that he get his own ship, but instead he turned it down to hang out with his friends.

The other plotline about him meeting his father is rather lackluster. However, we do get to see the ultimate form of martial arts - TRON suits fighting against each other! It's not very spectacular, though.

Lastly, we have a Klingon "birthday party." Worf has a 10-year celebration he should have with his family, but he doesn't have a family, so Wesley organizes it. It involves a lot of pain and screaming. The funny thing is that Miles O'Brien is there, and apparently, years later he forgot about the event, as he willingly joins his bachelorette party in DS9.
