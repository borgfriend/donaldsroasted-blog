In this episode, Data accidentally intercepts a distress call from a little girl on a planet that is not yet aware of aliens or space travel. The Prime Directive prohibits the Enterprise from providing any assistance, posing a dilemma about how much interference in a planet's natural order is acceptable. The crew eventually manages to save the planet using their advanced technology, but it remains uncertain whether their intervention was justified.

This episode serves as an early exploration of the ethical implications of the Prime Directive, which will be further examined in later episodes.
