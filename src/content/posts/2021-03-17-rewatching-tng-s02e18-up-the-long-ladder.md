The episode has a classic science fiction setup, with a group of people who believe that technology is evil and decide to start a new life on a new planet without it. They hitch a ride with a group that thinks technology will solve all problems, but they end up on separate planets.

Interestingly, the colony without technology becomes trapped when their sun explodes and they need to be evacuated. This creates a fish-out-of-water situation, with old traditions clashing with modern concepts. Riker becomes acquainted with the female leader of the colony, who subscribes to the old tradition that men are useless and always drunk, while women do all the work.

When they encounter the second colony, they have also made a grave mistake. They have given up sex in favor of cloning, which is ultimately doomed. In the end, Picard and the male leaders of both colonies decide to join the colonies, with each man fathering three children with different women. The women initially complain, but then seem to like the idea of polygamy, resulting in a bright future for the colony.

The episode doesn't take a strong stance on sexuality or polygamy, simply presenting it as a neutral solution. It also doesn't explore the flaws of either approach (no tech vs. only tech). Nonetheless, it offers some food for thought as we consider the challenges of colonizing Mars.
