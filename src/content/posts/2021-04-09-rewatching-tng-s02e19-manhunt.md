This episode of Star Trek is somewhat peculiar. In it, Lwaxana Troi pays a visit to the Enterprise and attempts to seduce Captain Picard. She seems to be experiencing a phase of heightened sexual desire and is seeking another partner. Throughout the episode, Picard tries to avoid her advances.

The show suggests that Lwaxana's telepathic abilities may be impaired due to her condition. However, at the end of the episode, she demonstrates full control and advanced skills, indicating that she could read Picard's thoughts. It's unclear why Picard doesn't act on his desires, and the show doesn't explain this.

The episode also introduces some fish-like aliens, who explore how humans react to and avoid things that are different. The show emphasizes that we don't need to fear other cultures. However, the twist is that these aliens turn out to be assassins who plan to kill everyone, reminding us that some caution is necessary.

If you enjoy Lwaxana's character, you will likely enjoy this episode. If not, you can skip it.
