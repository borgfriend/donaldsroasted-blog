The Writers Guild of America strike, which took place in 1988, did have an impact on the production of "Shades of Gray," as well as several other episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation's second season.

The production team decided to make "Shades of Gray" as a clip show, using footage from previous episodes to create a new storyline. The resulting episode is not the best and luckily the only 'clip show' episode of the series.

You can safely skip this episode.
