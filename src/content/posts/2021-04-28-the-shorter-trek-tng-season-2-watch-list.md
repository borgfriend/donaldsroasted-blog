In Season 2 of Star Trek: The Next Generation, there were several standout episodes that are definitely worth watching. Some of my personal favorites include:

* Episode 3: "Elementary Dear Data"
* Episode 8: "A Matter of Honor"
* Episode 9: "The Measure of a Man"
* Episode 15: "Pen Pals" (a "Prime Directive" episode)
* Episode 16: "Q Who" (which introduces the Borg)
* Episode 17: "The Samaritan Snare" (which introduces the Pakled and is important for Star Trek: Lower Decks)
* Episode 20: "The Emissary" (a Klingon/Worf episode)
* Episode 21: "Peak Performance"
