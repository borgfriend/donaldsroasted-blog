In the last clipshow episode, Wesley Crusher was so bored that he fell asleep while experimenting with Nanomachines. He added a few parameters and accidentally created a new lifeform that began consuming the Enterprise's computer systems.

This episode contrasts Wesley with Dr. Stubs, who was once a prodigy and has spent his entire life working on an experiment that can only be conducted once every 200 years. The episode also includes hints about the Borg, which may become important later in the season.

The story explores the potential miscommunications that can arise when encountering a new lifeform for the first time, as well as the burden of living up to one's potential. While the ramifications of accidentally creating a new lifeform are not fully explored, the nanites are ultimately given their own planet to call home.

Overall, this is a strong first episode that raises intriguing questions about the nature of life and the potential consequences of scientific experimentation.
