When it comes to city simulators, they're usually not my cup of tea, as they tend to be endless games without a concrete end goal. However, Frostpunk changes the concept entirely. In this game, you start off with a generator and a handful of survivors, and your task is simple: survive.

## GamePlay

The basic gameplay is quite simple - you must manage resources (for construction, keeping the generator and people alive), and manage people's needs (housing, medical, and other necessities). Your primary objective is to balance these two areas, so nothing too special there.

However, the game does something brilliant - it introduces a legal system that forces you to pass laws that affect your abilities. These laws are moral and ethical choices that significantly impact your colony, from the types of buildings you can construct to the satisfaction of your population. Each decision comes with its own tradeoffs, with significant positive effects but also negative consequences. For example, you can choose to make your colony purely faith-based, which will ensure that your population never loses hope. The downside is that you will have to exile non-believers who will likely freeze to death in the cold.


## Story Mode

The game's objective is to tell the story of the survivors, with several game events that impact the game situation. The brilliance of the game lies in the fact that even if you choose to avoid negative story beats, you cannot avoid them entirely, and you will have to deal with the problems as they come up. As you grow along with your colony and try to protect it from the cold, you become connected to your freezing population through the game's animation and crowd movement.

## Why should you play the game?

The fascinating thing about Frostpunk is that it allows you to make ethical and moral decisions and then deal with their long-term effects. You can learn something about yourself, reconsider what hard choices you would make, and reassess what's important to you and how you perceive the real world. That's why you should definitely play this game.
