This episode is a masterpiece of science fiction that delves into the consequences of an advanced alien civilization encountering a developing one.

It is a must-watch for anyone interested in exploring ideas about religion, technology, and our perspective of the world. The episode also raises important moral implications, such as whether a society that worships you as gods should be guided by your influence.

Interestingly, years later, the TV show Stargate SG-1 would explore a similar question with the Asgard race, albeit in a completely different way.
