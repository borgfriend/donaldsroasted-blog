In this episode, an away mission goes awry, resulting in the tragic death of a woman killed by an ancient booby trap. The woman leaves behind a teenage son who is now orphaned.

The aliens responsible for the trap feel remorse and send a member to comfort and adopt the child. This alien pretends to be the deceased woman, attempting to convince the boy to stay on the planet. Meanwhile, Worf, who feels responsible for the woman's death, also desires to take care of the child.

The episode grapples with the difficult topic of death. There is a poignant conversation between Data and Riker, where Data questions why we don't mourn the loss of those we are not close to in the same way as those we are. Riker replies that if we did mourn all loss of life equally, humans would have a much less violent past.

The episode emphasizes the need to find acceptance of our mortality and the loss of loved ones. We cannot live in the past, but rather we must bond with others and support each other in overcoming our losses.

The episode indirectly raises the question of whether single parents should serve in the military and take the risk of orphaning their children.
