The Wish Dragon is a charming tale about a boy who longs to reunite with his friend. The classic Aladdin story is retold in a Chinese setting. Overall a cute story.

One aspect of the story that stands out is the creation of the "teapot" by a god who teaches the protagonist a valuable lesson about life. This god, who appears as a crazy old man while on Earth, is an intriguing character. The idea that anyone, even the eccentric, could be a deity encourages viewers to treat everyone with kindness and respect.
