In this episode, a wormhole is discovered, and various factions meet to determine who will control it. Unfortunately, the episode also includes a 'romance' plot involving Troi being manipulated.

The episode explores the manipulation techniques used in trade negotiations. Each alien race attempts to gain the upper hand through both legal and illegal means. The Ferengi, for instance, try to poison the other negotiators, while the Federation gains trust by acting as a neutral party and inviting everyone to the conference. Other species even use mind readers to conduct espionage.

In the end, the wormhole proves to be unstable, and the Ferengi become trapped in the Delta Quadrant. This event is further explored in Voyager.

There are clear parallels to the first episode of Deep Space Nine, where the discovery and control of the wormhole fundamentally change the importance of the region of space.
