In this episode, the Enterprise encounters an ancient trap that siphons off energy, preventing it from leaving. To make the necessary modifications to the engine and escape, Jordi creates a hologram of the designer of the Enterprise engines.

One of the most intriguing aspects of this episode is how it addresses the challenges of dating for nerds in the future. The computer accidentally creates a hologram of the original designer, and Jordi requests to recreate her personality based on her public appearances. Given the current technology to create deep fake images, this scenario could be plausible in the future. However, the episode doesn't explore the moral implications of creating a hologram of a real person (though this is addressed in a future episode).

Jordi becomes infatuated with the hologram, but ultimately recognizes it as an illusion and ends the program. Interestingly, the episode suggests that love relationships in the future will be similar to those of today, despite the constant changes and adjustments in relationships over time.

It's regrettable that the episode doesn't delve more into how technology could impact dating rituals. However, dating is typically viewed as a biological process, and we tend not to consider how technology may affect and alter dating culture.
