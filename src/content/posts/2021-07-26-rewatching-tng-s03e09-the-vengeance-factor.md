In "The Vengeance Factor," we see the complex dynamics of tribal warfare and how it can hinder progress towards peace. The episode highlights how deep-seated grudges and genetics can perpetuate conflict, even when it seems illogical or counterproductive.

However, the episode falls short in exploring how to heal the wounds and find common ground between warring factions. Instead, the emphasis is on finding and punishing the troublemakers, rather than working towards a more sustainable and peaceful solution. This narrow focus is a missed opportunity to delve deeper into the complexities of conflict resolution and reconciliation.

Despite this limitation, the episode raises important questions about the role of tradition, vengeance, and forgiveness in the pursuit of peace.
