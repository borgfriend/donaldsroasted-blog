At first glance, this episode seems like an action-packed story about a hunt for an escaped prisoner. It provides intricate technical details on how the Enterprise can be outsmarted. The prisoner even manages to deceive Data and sends out misleading signals, among other things.

In many ways, the episode is reminiscent of the first Rocky movie. However, the episode is actually about how to help veterans reintegrate into society.

The episode is well-written and keeps the audience engaged throughout. The ending is left open, as it remains unclear whether the alien race will change its ways moving forward.
