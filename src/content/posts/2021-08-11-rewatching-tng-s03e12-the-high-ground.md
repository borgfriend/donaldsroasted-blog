Moving on to another depressing topic, in the previous episode, we had to confront the issue of veterans. This week's episode tackles the big question of terrorism.

The episode takes a nuanced look at the complexity of dealing with deeply rooted conflicts. It doesn't take a side in the government versus terrorist debate, as both sides are already resorting to extreme measures to manage the situation. The episode delves into the reasons why terrorism escalates and highlights that there is no clear and simple solution to end the conflict to the satisfaction of both sides.

The episode concludes with a glimmer of hope, as the killing has temporarily ceased. However, the conflict remains unresolved.

Overall, the episode covers a lot of ground in a short amount of time. It leaves the audience with something to ponder, as it sheds light on the complexities of dealing with terrorism.
