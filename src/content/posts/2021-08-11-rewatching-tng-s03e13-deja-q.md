A moon is hurtling uncontrollably towards a planet, and nothing can stop it. Suddenly, Q appears, stripped of his powers and seeking asylum on the Enterprise as a mere mortal human.

While the crew is trying to determine whether Q is just playing another trick on them, other aliens attempt to take advantage of the situation and seek revenge against Q. Unfortunately, the overall framing of the episode is rather lackluster.

However, what makes this episode stand out is the dynamic between Q and Data. Q, struggling to be human, learns a great deal from the android, who is grappling with his own journey towards humanity.

In the end, Q sacrifices himself to save the Enterprise and is restored his powers, allowing him to save the planet from the moon. He also gives Data an incredible gift, which is sadly ruined by the Star Trek movies later on.

Overall, the episode offers a great balance of drama and lighthearted Q fun, with Q and Data's relationship serving as the standout element.
