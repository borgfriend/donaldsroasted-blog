Due to a temporal anomaly, the Enterprise-C is pulled from the past into the future, resulting in a significant alteration of the timeline. Guinan is the only one who is aware of this change.

There are several elements to love about this episode. It highlights how small events can have a significant impact on the entire galaxy and shows the characters what would have happened if they had been at war for years instead of living in peace. Additionally, we witness Worf's introduction to prune juice, which he thoroughly enjoys.

The episode also provides a fitting sendoff for Tasha Yar and serves as an apology for the random tar monster.

This episode also marks the first appearance of the alternate reality Enterprise crew. Although TNG never visits the Mirror Universe, the Klingon-Federation conflict is the starting point of Star Trek: Discovery.

The Enterprise-C ship design is another noteworthy aspect, blending design elements of both the Enterprise-A and the Enterprise-D. This design showcases the progression between the two eras in Star Trek.
