Lower Decks" Season 1 was unexpectedly good. I was eagerly anticipating what would happen next, such as Boimler's progress on the Titan, Mariner's continued rebellion against the status quo, and how Tendi and Rutherford would process the events of the Season 1 finale.

The episode starts off with an exciting Holodeck action sequence, filled with great callbacks to the original series. However, the rest of the episode was not as great.

Mariner wants to do a side quest and clean up the city, which accidentally releases "strange energies," causing Ransom to become a god. Meanwhile, Tendi thinks it's odd that Rutherford has changed and likes to eat pears, only to realize she is jealous that he has a date. The side plot was somewhat fun, until Tendi becomes unhinged and hunts Rutherford down with a gun, forcing him to raise a literal forcefield between them.

Ransom is portrayed as a representation of toxic masculinity, as he becomes obsessed with himself and wants big statues of himself everywhere. His needs are portrayed as needy and seeking attention from his captain, making him seem pathetic and weak. The writers could have taken a better approach, as the two women were making it difficult for him to do his job. Instead, they portrayed men as unwelcome and unneeded.

Captain Freeman is about to fix the situation by talking to Ransom and addressing the problematic relationship between her and Mariner. However, that doesn't happen and Mariner just repeatedly kicks Rutherford in the groin. At the end of the episode, the women are portrayed as being right and facing zero consequences for Tendi's abuse of medical authority over Rutherford. Although Mariner is briefly put in a jail cell, it is not relevant as she is no longer there in the next episode and hasn't learned anything. Everyone's character development is reset to the beginning of Season 1, except Mariner, who now seems to be mightier than a god.

Hopefully, the next episode will be better.
