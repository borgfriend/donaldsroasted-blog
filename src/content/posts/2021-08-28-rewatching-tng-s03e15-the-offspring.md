This episode is quite interesting as it continues to ask philosophical questions about the nature of Data. In this case, the question is whether he is allowed to procreate. Well, Data doesn't have to ask that question; he just builds himself an offspring.

It is fascinating to see the android start to learn and adapt. One of the more interesting aspects of the episode is that the android is allowed to choose its gender. There is a small debate on this subject, as this will profoundly influence the social interactions the android will experience. The android chooses to be female and wants to be called Lal.

The episode then delves into a couple of rather dark ideas, such as the question of who is better suited to raise children: the parents or the state? An admiral wants to raise the android with a team of experienced specialists, versus the original parent who is inexperienced and raising his first child.

Since Data's child is seen as property, the admiral makes the argument that he should be able to take away that property. Naturally, Data wants to protect his child and teach her as much as possible while also considering what is best for his daughter. Picard steps in and delays the process as much as possible, defending the rights of the child.

In the end, they ask Lal what she wants. However, as she is an evolution of Data, she experiences fear and ultimately dies of this trauma. Data downloads her experiences, and she 'lives on' in him.

Overall, it is an interesting exploration of how Data could evolve in the future, as well as a strong reminder of the importance of parenthood and the danger of an overreaching government.
