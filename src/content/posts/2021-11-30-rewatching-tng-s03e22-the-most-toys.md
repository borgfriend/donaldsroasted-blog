This is another great Data episode. The episode begins with Data being presumed dead after a shuttle accident, which deeply affects the crew. However, they deduce that it was all just a ruse and that he has been kidnapped by a collector named Fajo, who has no morals and values unique items above everything else.

It is nice to see how the various people adjust to the new situation, and how Jordi really cares about his friend. There is also a nice scene with Picard and Jordi, where it is as first business as usual, but Picard is also having his difficulties to deal with the loss of Data.

The episode explores the clash of values between Fajo and Data, with Data being programmed to always act morally and value life. Fajo however is a man that has no morals. 

He creates a physical trap for Data, he cannot escape his prison. He then wants that Data cooperates and entertains his guests. Fajo presents Data with logical and moral dilemmas in an attempt to coerce him into cooperating, but Data remains steadfast in refusing. Eventually, Fajo's persistence pays off as Data finds himself trapped and unable to escape.

Eventually Data escapes. However, in the last showdown between Data and Fajo - Fajo taunts him, that he will continue harming other people - and Data cannot do anything against that. Data replies and answers, "I cannot permit this to continue." A moment later, he raises his hand to fire, but is beamed to the enterprise. O'Brian sees that the phaser has discharged and disables it. Data simply states, "it must have malfunctioned".

You can now interpret this scene as you like. Data may have done something that was not intended by his programming and evolved At that moment. Enabling Data to be a judge and executioner of Fajo - and that he now can lie as well. Or of course that there was simply a malfunction.

I would say this is one of the must watch episodes of the series. Additionally many years later, in Star Trek: Lower Decks the crew of the USS Cerritos encounters another "collector'.
