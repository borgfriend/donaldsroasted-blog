Tron 2.0 is undoubtedly one of the most outstanding games ever created. Nevertheless, it has regrettably not received the widespread recognition it deserves.

Despite this, a couple of highly committed individuals at [lsdo](http://www.ldso.net) have taken it upon themselves to ensure that the game continues to function seamlessly on modern systems. Furthermore, they have gone above and beyond by creating two additional expansions.

These expansions boast an impressive storyline for a mod and introduce new types of foes that seamlessly fit into the Tron 2.0 Universe.
